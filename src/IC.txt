V = 11:;  Size 6.3x5.1;  Surf Br = 14.0

18" (7/15/07): at 225x this Local Group member (M31 subgroup) appeared faint, fairly large, 
slightly elongated NW-SE, ~4.5'x3.5', low even surface brightness except fades at the edges.  A 
mag 13 star is superimposed west of center and a fainter star follows.

18" (10/8/05): picked up fairly easily at 115x as a large, low surface brightness hazy region with 
a mag 13 star superimposed.  Good view at 160x using the Meade 14mm Ultrawide.  Appeared 
faint, large, slightly elongated, ~4'-5' diameter (though no distinct borders) with a patchy, 
mottled appearance, very weak concentration.  Several faint stars (besides the mag 13 star) are 
superimposed.  Situated within a rich star field and appears similar to a low surface brightness 
emission or reflection nebula.

13.1" (11/5/83): very faint, moderately large, elongated NW-SE.  Unusually low even surface 
brightness.  A mag 13 star is superimposed near the center.  Located in a very rich star field just 
3.3° from the galactic plane!  Member of the Local Group.

00 59 29 +60 54 40
Size 10x3

18" (7/15/07): unusual triangle or wedge-shaped nebula just 20' NE of Gamma Cas.  At 115x 
appears fairly large, elongated SW-NE, ~6' diameter, with the brighter vertex at the west end. 
The southern edge which extends towards the SW is slightly brighter and more sharply defined.  
The interior of the wedge is slightly fainter with subtle brightness variations.  The OIII or UHC 
filter dimmed the object which contradicts my previous observation.  Brighter than IC 59 which 
is located 20' N of Gamma.

IC 0131 = M33-A29 = BCLMP 290
01 33 14.6 +30 44 56

18" (12/8/07): faint, quasi-stellar knot to the SE of a N-S pair of stars (this pair is also collinear 
with N592 located 6' S of IC 131).  According to Corwin this compact HII region was assumed 
to be a mag 13.5 star by Bigourdan and IC 131 refers to two very small star clouds close 
following (seen in the 10/25/97 observation but missed this time). The nearly stellar knot I 
observed is listed as BCLMP 290B.

17.5" (10/25/97): very faint, very small, round, 10" diameter.  This HII region is located 10' 
WNW of the center of M33 near a wide pair [50"] of mag 11/12 stars.  A mag 14 star is nearby 
and at first I thought this star was IC 131 (on the DSS this 14th magnitude "star" is a compact 
HII region and was also described as a star by Bigourdan).  Collinear with IC 133 8' N and IC 
132 11.5' N.

18" (12/8/07): faint, fairly large, very low surface brightness patch, ~1.5' diameter, located 3.5' S 
of IC 135.  Appears roughly circular, though the outline is ill-defined.  This object is not as 
prominent as nearby IC 139/140 (to the W and SW) and IC 135 to the north.

17.5" (10/25/97): very faint, ill-defined hazy region in M33 between IC 135 3.5' N and a mag 
11.5 star 2.5' SSE (just west of the line connecting these objects).  Appears as a slightly locally 
brighter region of 30" diameter and not as noticeable as the other IC HII regions - would have 
passed over if casually sweeping galaxy.  This star association may have a smaller HII 
component.

V = 11.7;  Size 5

17.5" (8/5/97): position identified at 100x using a GSC chart, although only a couple of stars are 
plotted.  Appears as a very faint circular glow with a couple of faint stars superimposed.  Located 
7' E of a wide pair of mag 9/11 stars [at 38" separation].  Does not resemble a cluster in 
appearance and would have otherwise thought this was a Milky Way patch. At 220x, the glow is 
~4' in diameter and there are a sprinkling of ~10 very faint stars, mostly mag 14.5-15.5 with one 
mag 13 star.  The glow has an irregular surface brightness with a mottled appearance and the 
periphery is not well defined.

17.5" (12/16/95): this is an unusual object consisting of a scattered group with associated 
nebulosity and near a large dark cloud virtually void of stars.  The cluster consists of 15 stars of 
varying magnitudes in a 6' group located 5'-10' south of Omicron = 38 Persei (V = 3.8).  The 
brightest star in the group is mag 8.4 SAO 56680 and it's clearly encased in a fairly bright 
reflection nebula, ~3' diameter, which involves two nearby companions.  The star at the SW end 
of the cluster is a nice close evenly matched double (?437 = 9.8/10 at 11").  The immediate 50' 
low power field to the south is strangely devoid of almost all stars! (LDN 1470 = Barnard 3 and

17.5" (2/22/03): at 100x, the bright 10.5 magnitude central star was centered in a 10" round halo 
with a definite rosy or raspberry tint at the outer edge of the halo, though the effect is fairly 
subtle.  Using an H-beta filter, the central star is strongly dimmed but the halo is significantly 
enhanced, dramatically changing the view of this planetary.  At 380x, no color was visible but 
the halo was a bit asymmetrical with a "softer" edge and possible double shell structure.  The 
center was very slightly darker around the central star.

17.5" (12/30/99): at 82x the mag 10.5 central star was enveloped in a very small round halo 
which appeared to have a slight reddish tinge at its edge.  This is a low-excitation PN and using a 
H-beta filter, the halo brightened and the central star faded, leaving a more noticeable disc.  At 
220x, the prominent central star was surrounded by a well-defined 10" halo which partially 
"blinked" on and off switching from averted to direct vision.  At 280x, the small halo was 
possibly surrounded by an extremely faint envelope, but this could not be confirmed.  380x and 
500x presented a superb view of the inner disc which appeared weakly annular.

17.5" (3/8/97): unusually bright mag 10.5 central star surrounded by a small high surface

partially washes out the halo and with averted the halo is more dominant.  At 82x, an unusual 
rosy tinge is evident at the edge of the small halo, although the effect is fairly subdued.  The 
seeing was not steady enough for high power viewing of the outer shell.

17.5": high surface brightness planetary which appears very bright at 481x.  Contains a bright

V = 14.6;  Size 0.5x0.5;  Surf Br = 13.1

17.5" (3/8/97): HCG 59B is the fainter of two visible in HCG 59 and located 1.9' ESE of IC 737 
= HCG 59A.  Very faint, small, round, 20" diameter.  With averted vision, the halo is closer to 
30" (similar to IC 736) but the surface brightness is slightly lower.

Several catalogues (including RC3, MCG and CGCG) identify IC 736 with HCG 59A = MCG 
+02-30-039 = CGCG 068-070 and IC 737 with HCG 59D = MCG +02-30-040 = CGCG 068-
072.  When I took a look at this group, this immediately seemed odd as the brightest pair of 
galaxies are clearly HCG 59A and HCG 59B and I HCG 59D which the modern catalogues 
identify as IC 737.

The IC discovery is from Javelle using the 30 inch refractor at the Nice observatory.  His 
micrometric measurements are generally excellent and his rounded positions precessed to 1950 
are as follows:

IC 736  11 45 45 +12 59.6
IC 737  11 45 53 +13 00.2

Now, compare these to the Hickson's 1950 positions for 59B and 59A, respectively and they are 
a dead-on match:

HCG 59B  11 45 45.6 +12 59 38.7
HCG 59A  11 45 52.9 +13 00 19.0

As this pair was also the most prominent visually in my 17.5", the modern catalogues are 
incorrect and
IC 736 = HCG 59B = MCG +02-30-037 = CGCG 068-068 = PGC 36853
IC 737 = HCG 59A = MCG +02-30-039 = CGCG 068-070 = PGC 36861

Re-reducing Javelle's offsets (and ignoring proper motion of the offset star) gives for J2000
J203    11 48 19.5 +12 42 56
J204    11 48 27.6 +12 43 35

GSC positions for these galaxies are:
IC 736  11 48 20.1 +12 42 59
IC 737  11 48 27.5 +12 43 38
As these positions are within a few arcseconds, my revised identifications are certain.

17.5" (5/30/92): extremely faint, very small.  I could only glimpse this object for moments with 
averted vision but it appeared very elongated 3:1 SW-NE and extremely thin.  Forms a pair with 
N5217 3' WNW.  Observation verified on the POSS.

This galaxy is identified in all modern sources as CGCG 102-020 and IC 897 is assigned to a 
thin edge-on, UGC 08544, located 10' SW.  This identification is based on Bigourdan's position, 
but he apparently misidentified his offset star as IC 897 is described at a separation of 3.5' at PA 
105° from N5217 and when corrected his offset falls on CGCG 102-020.

18" (8/30/08): picked up unfiltered at 175x as a faint, 25" knot just 3' E of Hubble V.  Mild 
contrast gain adding a NPB filter.  Located 1.7' NW of a mag 12 star (close double) at the north 
end of NGC 6822.  Slightly lower surface brightness than Hubble V to the west.

17.5" (9/1/02): following of two HII regions at the north end of Barnard's galaxy. Easily visible 
with averted vision at 220x without a filter and there is mild contrast gain using an OIII filter at 
140x.

17.5" (7/14/99): following of a pair of HII regions with Hubble V at the north end of N6822 = 
Barnard's galaxy.  Visible with direct vision at 220x and 280x without a filter.  There was a mild 
contrast gain using a UHC filter at these magnifications.

17.5" (8/21/98): easily visible at 220x without a filter as a 30" round knot along with Hubble V 
just 3.1' W.  Because I had no problem viewing this HII region without filtration I didn't blink or 
use an OIII filter.

17.5" (5/10/91): HII region on the NE edge of N6822.  At 82x and OIII filter appears as a faint, 
very small but clearly nebulous round knot.  Estimate mag 14.  A mag 12 star lies 2' SE (very 
close double on the POSS).  Not seen without a filter.  Forms a pair with similar Hubble V just 3' 
W.

17.5" (8/2/97): picked up at 100x as a small nebulous patch in a rich Milky Way field 
surrounding a mag 13 star.  Does not stand out well at this power due to the rich environment but 
the glow has a noticeably higher surface brightness than the unresolved Milky Way glow.  Better 
view at 220x as a faint sprinkling of stars are superimposed (8-10 with averted vision) and the 2' 
cluster has an irregular outline.  Appears similar to a partially resolved globular.  A nice mag 
12/13 double star [9" separation] is off the NE end 1.5' from center.  The view holds up well at 
410x and one or two additional faint stars were resolved.

18" (7/13/07): Both portions of the "Butterfly Nebula" were easily visible at 12.5x in my 80mm 
finder using an H-beta filter and were an amazing sight in the 18-inch at 73x using both H-beta 
and UHC filters as they stretched across the entire 67' field of field and separated by a wide dark 
lane (LDN 889).
IC 1318d (centered ~1° E of Gamma Cyg) passes through two 7th magnitude stars (HD 194789 
and HD 194908) and is very prominent near these stars.  This swath of nebulosity courses mainly 
SW and NE from these stars.  To the west of the bright stars, the nebula is bifurcated into two 
forks by a dark lane.  To the N and NE of the stars, the nebulosity spreads out wider and is 
interspersed with darker regions.  Overall the surface brightness of this section is fairly high but 
varies quite a bit in intensity and is slightly brighter on the following side of the NE end where it 
contrasts with the wide dust lane that separates IC 1318e to the SE.

IC 1318e is situated roughly 35' SE of IC 1318d on the opposite side of dark nebula LDN 889.  
This bright section passes through several wide double stars and gently curves as it sweeps from 
SW to NE.  The overall length is at least 35'x10' (not as wide as on photographs but nearly as 
long).  One or two darker spots or regions lie within the nebulosity although it appears as a single 
continuous piece without as much structure as IC 1318d.

IC 1318b is possibly the brightest piece of the IC 1318 complex and is located ~2° NW of 
Gamma Cyg (Sadr.  At 73x and either H-beta or UHC filter, it appeared very extended SW-NE 
or WSW-ENE, roughly 40'x8' and passes through a mag 8 star.  This section was easily visible at 
12.5x in the 80mm finder using a H-beta filter.  The brightest portion is to the NE of the mag 8 
star and a number of similar mag stars are involved with this portion.  Removing the filter, this 
section was still visible though the highest contrast was using a UHC filter.  To the SW of the 
star, this river of nebulosity takes a mild bend and flows more towards the south.  Another fainter 
section of nebulosity (not included in the size estimate) spreads out to the NNW of the mag 8 
star.

12.5x80mm (7/13/07):  viewed in 80mm finder using an H-beta filter.  The two roughly parallel 
brightest sections to the east of Gamma that form the "Butterfly Nebula" (IC 1318d and 1318e) 
were obvious as extremely large parallel strips oriented ~SW-NE and separated by a wide dark 
lane.

16x80 (8/23/84): extremely large complex of irregular emission nebulae surrounded Gamma 
Cygni (position given) with six sections visible at 16x using a UHC and H-beta filters.  Overfills 
the 4° finder field!  The most prominent section is an isolated patch NW of Gamma at the edge 
of the field (IC 1318b = Ced 176c = LBN 251 = DWB 82) and next are two parallel strips just E 
(IC 1318d = LBN 249) and SE of Gamma (IC 1318e = LBN 245) which have fairly sharp edges.

18" (8/14/07): I began this observation with a look at open cluster Cr 419 which surrounds 
?2666, a bright double with mag 6/8.5 components at 2.7".  This "cluster" is involved with a 
section of the Gamma Cygni complex (IC 1318c) and the surrounding field is very patchy with 
darker and brighter regions (dust and nebulosity) at 73x.  At 225x, this 5'-6' group also includes 
~3 dozen stars that generally appear to radiate outwards in strings from the bright double.

A darker annulus appears to nearly surround the cluster except off the east side where the field is 
weakly luminous unfiltered. Adding a UHC filter increases the contrast in the field and the 
cluster is clearly encased in a hazy glow (though the cluster stars may be contributed to this 
appearance) that extends to the east in a fan shape, spreading out to the SE and NE.  Fainter haze 
also extends to the west of the cluster for a shorter distance.  When I let the field drift, I realized 
that nebulosity extended ~30' SE from Cr 419, much further then I initially noticed.

field and were separated by a wide dark lane (LDN 889).  IC 1318d (centered ~1° E of Gamma

triple star (?2816 = 5.8/7.7/7.8 at 12" and 20") at the center of a scattered cluster although 
nebulosity is not apparent throughout the field.  About 25' away is also a pretty double star 
whose components are aligned with the triple star.  The surrounding 1° field contains a scattered 
cluster of brighter stars which are fairly uniformly distributed.

In the 16x80 finder without a filter, the entire cluster is clearly encased in a faint glow at least 
two degrees in diameter which seems to be more prominent along the curving lanes of the 
cluster.  The Daystar 300 filter gives a mild enhancement but dims the stars so the overall view is 
not as pleasing.  Mu Cephei (Herschel's Garnet Star) is at the NE edge, ~1.5° from the center.

16x80 (9/29/84 and 8/26/89): using a UHC filter appears as a very large, irregular nebulous glow 
(about 2° diameter).  Very faint but definite when compared without filter.  Surrounds ?2816 = 
5.8/7.7 at 12" and a large, faint, scattered star group.  Visible without a filter as an extremely 
large, hazy region surrounding ?2816 and fainter stars.

18" (10/13/07): easily swept up at 175x, located 4' W of mag 7.0 HD 215867.  Compared views 
unfiltered and with UHC, OIII and NPB filters.  Best seen using OIII, though NPB gave the most 
natural view with brighter stars. Two faint mag 14/15 stars are very near the NE edge (brighter 
star barely off edge) with a brighter mag 13 star 1' SE.  At 225x using the NPB filter, IC 1454 
appeared round, ~25-30" in diameter with an impression of an irregular surface brightness.  The 
rim sometimes appeared slightly brighter with a weaker center giving a very subtle annularity.

18" (10/9/04): easily picked up at 73x just 4' WNW of a 7th magnitude star as a small, well-
defined disc.  Visible unfiltered at 160x; a couple of mag 14/15 stars are barely off the NE edge 
of the planetary and a 13th magnitude star lies 1' SE.  Good contrast gain with OIII filter.  The 
disc is perfectly round, ~25" diameter with a very crisp edge.  The surface brightness appeared a 
bit irregular but could not verify annularity at this power.

17.5" (10/13/01): picked up at 100x without filter as a faint, small disc situated 4' WNW of a 
mag 7 star.  Excellent contrast gain with an OIII filter and appears as a round, 25" crisp-edged 
disc.  At 220x without filter a faint mag 14/15 pair is at the NE edge.  Very nice view using a 
UHC filter at 140x-220x; the PN is slightly elongated ~E-W but no other details are visible.

17.5" (8/8/91): moderately bright, fairly small, almost round, slightly elongated E-W, 30" 
diameter.  A faint double star mag 14/15 is at the NE edge.  Located 3.8' WNW of mag 7 SAO

it was part of the N524 group.  But with a redshift of z = .048 compared to 0.008, this galaxy lies 
six times further away in the heart of AGC 193 and Shk 40!  At 225x it appeared faint to fairly 
fairly, small, irregular round, slightly brighter core.  The core or a stellar knot seemed offset to 
one side (double galaxy).  A mag 12 star is less than 1' NW.  This description is quite similar to 
the one two months back.

18" (10/13/07): NGC 896 and IC 1795 form a bright, detailed HII region at the NW corner of the 
huge IC 1805 HII ring ("Heart Nebula").  This complex is split into three or 4 distinct sections by 
dust lanes (LDN 1359).  The largest section is IC 1795, which extends mostly north of a mag 10 
star for ~8'.  To the west of the mag 10 star is a  dust lane oriented NW-SE and beyond this lane 
to the west is a small, moderatly high surface brightness patch (NGC 896) of 2' diameter.  To the 
east of the star is another broad dust lane extending N-S and following this lane is a fainter wash 
of nebulosity that streams to the north for over 15' in length.  It passes through mag 9 SAO 
12287 and just north of this star the nebulosity has a small, brighter patch.  Initially, I thought the

Most of the stars are located along the irregular ring, itself, and not in the interior. On the SW 
side is the brightest member, mag 8 HD 15558, which has a mag 10.5 companion at 10" 
separation (ADS 1920). The central clustering is richest around this HD star with 9 or 10 stars in 
total packed into a 1.6' region.

Adding an OIII filter, the cluster was encased in a fairly bright, irregular glow, ~12-15' in 
diameter and extending mostly to the east of the cluster. There appears to be dark lanes or 
obscuring dust involved as the surface brightness is irregular with brighter filaments within the 
glow. Fainter nebulosity extends to the east and then abruptly bifurcates into two branches, one 
heading NE and the other SE. There's a sharp border to the nebulosity at the split as the sky 
directly east immediately darkens, adding to the contrast.

Following the stream of nebulosity to the NE, it extends roughly 20' in that direction but then 
curves back sharply towards the west where it meanders for 30'-40', ending about 30' N of the 
cluster. Only 20' E of the bend at the NE corner is a fairly large open cluster, NGC 1027, but I 
didn't want to get sidetracked.

The southern river of nebulosity can be followed around in a huge loop. First it gently curves to 
the south or SSE for ~40' and then loops back sharply towards the west (this band forms the 
southern boundary of the Heart) for at least 40', heading towards a distinctive N-S string of 5 
stars with a length of 6'. This group is catalogued as Markarian 6 = Stock 7. At the south end of 
Mrk 6 are two doubles, ?264 = 8.6/9.8 at 17" and a mag 10/11 pair at 17".

At this point, the rim bends to the north and brightens noticeably in a 10' patch. It dims and 
continues on further to the north, passing about 25' W of the cluster and fades out pretty close to 
NGC 896, a nearly isolated bright patch to the NW of the main structure.

I had now traced around the entire outline of the "Heart Nebula" visible on wide-field images, 
scanning over a degree and a half from north to south and perhaps 1.25° in extent from west to 
east. The entire outline, including the weaker interior glow, was also visible at 12.5x in my 
80mm finder using an OIII filter, although without the detail visible in the main scope.

NGC 896 and IC 1795 are parts of a fairly bright, detailed region at the NW corner of this huge 
ring. The complex appears split into three or 4 distinct sections by dust lanes (LDN 1359). The 
largest section is IC 1795, which extends mostly north of a mag 10 star for ~8'. To the west of 
the mag 10 star is a dust lane oriented NW-SE and beyond this lane to the west is a small, 
moderately high surface brightness glow (NGC 896) of 2' diameter. To the east of the star is 
another broad dust lane extending N-S and east of this lane is a fainter wash of nebulosity that 
streams to the north for over 15' in length. It passes through mag 9 SAO 12287 and just north of 
this star the nebulosity has another small, brighter patch. Initially, I thought the complex ended 
here on the NE side, but additional fainter nebulosity was noticed spreading out to the west, 
increasing the total size to 15'-20' for both N-S and E-W directions.

Comparing my descriptions to the MegaStar outline, I noticed that the cluster Mrk 6 (perhaps it's 
an asterism) is not plotted, although the brighter stars are, of course. Secondly, the outline shows 
a large gap between the NW end of the Heart and NGC 896. Visually, it appeared the Heart 
Nebula extended closer to 896. Finally, I picked up additional nebulosity to the north of NGC 
896 not shown on MegaStar.

17.5" (11/27/92): about 125 stars forming a bright, very large 40' field at 100x.  In the center is 
an oval ring consisting of about 30 stars within a 4'-5' diameter including a bright 8th magnitude 
multiple star (Stein 368).  The brighter stars in the outer region form a rough incomplete circular 
outline.  Using 100x with an OIII filter, the associated nebulosity (LBN 654) is clearly entwined 
within a large portion of the cluster.

18" (10/13/07): I only took a fairly quick look at this huge HII region ("Soul Nebula" or "Baby 
Nebula") at the end of the evening after a long examination of IC 1705 ("Heart Nebula").  In 
comparison, portions of this object clearly have a higher surface brightness using an OIII filter at 
73x.  Near the center is an E-W elongated, scattered group of stars (Cr 32), ~10'x4' in size.  On 
the west end are two mag 7/8.3 with a number of fainter stars huddled nearby.  About 60' to the 
ENE is another larger, scattered group (Cr 34).  Weak nebulosity is evident throughout the field 
without a filter.

Adding an OIII filter greatly increases the contrast and nebulosity is fairly prominent in several 
different sections.  About 20' E of the Cr 32 is a brighter, elongated patch.  To the east of this 
patch is a dark lane or intrusion and on the eastern side is a brighter, 10' circular glow (IC 1871) 
with an irregular outline. IC 1871 is located roughly 45' ENE of Cr 32.  This patch is irregular in 
surface brightness with brighter streaks.  A larger region spreads out to the east of the cluster 
increasing the total length to over 1.5 degrees.  I also noticed brighter regions of nebulosity to the 
west of Cr 32, but didn't take notes on this area or try to follow the entire outline of the complex.

17.5" (10/2/99): at 100x, this large but weak grouping is dominated by a 2' pair of mag 7/8 stars 
which are both surrounded by several close, faint companions.  The surrounding one degree field 
is undistinguished but it appears weakly concentrated around the bright pair.  Faint nebulosity is 
visible in portions of the field.  At 220x, the view is striking with ~12 stars huddled around the 
southern mag 9 star including a nice pair of mag 12 stars nearly collinear and equally spaced.  
The brighter mag 7 star (?306) is surrounded by 8-10 companions.  The 20' field is fairly rich 
but scattered with a matched pair of mag 9 stars ~10' N.

Using a UHC filter at 100x, the field is immersed in a very large, faint nebulosity about a degree 
in length, elongated E-W.  A large, bright region elongated N-S is at the E end, ~35  following 
the core, and seems detached from the main cloud.  It surrounds a weak scattered group (Cr 34) 
which is void of stars in the center.  The main body of nebulosity has a sharper border and is 
generally brighter to the north of the core and fades into the background on the south side.  The 
outline is interesting on the north side with irregular extensions and bulges.  A small brighter 
circular patch stands out at the west end about 10' W of the core.

"double" with a mag 13.5 star just 18" SW.  At 220x the star is well separated and the planetary 
appears a bit irregular with an occasional sparkle.  Increasing the magnification to 325x, the 
appearance is definitely asymmetric with a fainter NW quadrant and an intermittent stellaring 
(superimposed star, knot, or the central star) to the SE of the geometric center.  At 450x, the 
dimmer quadrant on the NW side appears to bulge out slightly and the brighter region, centered

visible, though it was difficult to pinpoint the location.

13x80mm (1/15/07): first visual observation I've made of the Witch-Head nebula.  Using the 
80mm finder at 13x (24mm Panoptic) without a filter a very large, ill-defined glow (~30'-40') 
was visible between 1-1.5° south of Beta Eridani.  This is the NE section of this faint reflection 
nebula.  With averted vision the glow brightened and stood out fairly well compared to the 
background sky brightness.  This object is significantly fainter than Barnard's Loop but was 
surprisingly was not a marginal observation or as difficult as expected.  I couldn't follow the 
nebula further south with any certainty.

07 05.1 -10 42
Size 120x40

13x80mm (1/17/09): excellent view using of the Seagull Nebula using the 80mm finder with a 
24mm Panoptic and a NPB filter.  This long sinuous river of nebulosity winds for approximately 
two degrees ~N-S beginning just south of open cluster N2335 and curving to the west of a 4' pair 
of mag 5.4/7.7 stars, midway along its length.  The south end is skewed and curves towards the 
SE.  The nebula is brighter along a central filament, particularly near the midway point and a 
dark notch intrudes on the west side just south.  Although the 18" at 73x and UHC filter added 
more detail and structure only half of the entire Seagull could be viewed in one field.

13.1" (1/19/85): at 62x and UHC filter appears as a very large, very elongated strip of nebulosity.  
At the north end is the open cluster N2335 within Monoceros.  The southern portion is difficult 
to trace; it crosses into Canis Major and ends at an easily visible reflection nebula = Ced 90 
surrounding a mag 8 star.  Also includes nebula N2327 midway along the length.  This 
emission/reflection nebula is referred to as the Eagle or Seagull Nebula.

17.5" (2/2/02): On the NW side is a circular nebulosity (the head of the Seagull) catalogued as 
vdB 93 = Sh 2-292, although this is actually the object reported by Roberts and listed by Dreyer 
as IC 2177.  In my 17.5" at 100x, it appeared as a very large, circular glow perhaps 15' in 
diameter of low surface brightness surrounding mag 7.1 V750 Mon = BD-10 1848 with vague 
hints of structure. The OIII filter gave only a very weak enhancement, but the H-beta filter 
noticeably improved the contrast at low power.  This combination HII/reflection nebula is 
situated off the NW end of the huge winding IC 2177 strip which extends mostly to the south, 
and is a wonderfully rich region of the Milky Way with a number of clusters and star groups in 
the vicinity.

Off the south side is the smaller nebula Ced 90.  At 64x it appeared as a faint, round, 3'  haze 
surrounding a mag 8.5 star.  Two mag 10.5 stars are collinear off the east side, 2.5' and 3.3' from 
the center and several mag 12 stars are involved at the south edge.  The H-beta filter noticeably 
improves the contrast and makes the nebulosity a moderately bright, direct-vision object.  With 
averted vision the glow increases to 4'-5' in diameter with some very faint haze extending east.  
The star density drops off immediately to the west, except for a few stars.  Ced 90 is located at 
the extreme southern tip of the 2.5 degree giant emission nebula IC 2177 which extends north 
into Monoceros.  This is one of a select group of low-excitation nebulae that can be added to the 
list of H-beta objects.

Not found: At the separations given by Javelle from his reference star, DM +30°1834, no nebular 
image exists, however, if his RA separation sign was - 51s instead of the +51s which he gives it 
would then likely be the anon. ZWG 151-026 or NGC 2783B.  R3 lists this as Hickson 37B.  
DSFG lists as NGC 2783B.  Not listed in CGCG, UGC or MCG.  Listed in NGC 2000 (No

Verified that reversing Javelle's RA offset falls precisely on Hickson 37b, so this ID appears 
reasonable, particularly since I viewed it with my 17.5" and Javelle also viewed N2783 =

encased in nebulosity.  Additional haze extends beyond the cluster towards the SE for several 
arcminutes.  At this point there is a sharp bend and a bright section of nebulosity extends to the 
north.  This section is wider and brighter than other regions.  The brightest sections roughly form 
a huge "7" shape, perhaps 30' in size!  This object is referred to as the "Running Chicken

From Harold Corwin's notes: IC 3834 is not, as so often supposed, NGC 4740 (which see; it is

Nor is it NGC 4726 (which also see), as first suggested by Howe and taken up by Dreyer in a 
couple of IC2 notes.  Bigourdan wisely threw out all the NGC numbers for his observation of 
this galaxy (or he was utterly confused and simply ignored them) and declared it a "nova", even 
though Howe had obviously seen, too.

18" (7/7/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this bright, compact planetary was picked up by 
blinking with an OIII filter at 128x.  IC 4191 forms the northern vertex of a small, distinctive

contrast gain of 2-3 magnitudes using the OIII filter.  Without a filter, the planetary has that 
distinctive bluish color of planetaries and is slightly non-stellar with an extremely high surface 
brightness.  At 293x a very small disc, perhaps 4"-5" in size is visible.  The magnitude appears 
very similar to the mag 10.6 star 1.1' SE.  Located 40' WNW of mag 4.8 Eta Muscae.

18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x, this irregular galaxy has a disrupted 
appearance or else is interacting with a companion.  The structure is difficult to separate but the 
brighter component on the NE side is moderately bright, small, elongated WNW-ESE.  Attached 
on the south side is a larger, but fainter extension oriented nearly perpendicular to the brighter 
component.  A faint star is at the edge.  Located 10' NE of mag 3.7 Eta Pavonis which interferes 
with viewing.

According to the article "Star formation in the irregular galaxy IC 4662" in A&A, 1990, 234,99 
the elongated knot on the NE side contains two giant HII regions comparable to the 30 Doradus 
complex!  IC 4662 is identical to He 2-269 (PK 328-17.1) which had been included by Henize 
(1967) in a list of planetary nebulae discovered through H-alpha emission on objective  prism

with a radial velocity of ~400 km/sec (less than 10 million l.y.).

18" (9/25/06): IC 5068 is the second of three very large emission nebulae roughly one degree 
south of the southern end of the Pelican Nebula.  At 113x and an OIII filter, this object appears 
very large, diffuse, irregular glow, roughly 25'x20'.  It is noticeably brighter in a 12' circular 
region about 10' north of a mag 7.3 star (HD 198690) and a group of brighter stars that are near 
the southeast side of the nebula.

To the northwest is a second large patch of nebulosity, generally designated IC 5068B, though if 
Espin's declination was off by 1.5°, this may be IC 5067.  This piece is very large and elongated 
NW to SE, extending perhaps 40'x15'.  It contains a bright circular 10' patch to the south of a 
mag 8 star (SAO 50061).  A broad river of faint nebulosity streams away towards the northwest

20 50.8 +44 21
Size 80x70

18" (7/17/07): The huge Pelican Nebula overfilled the 67' field in the 31 Nagler.  The UHC filter 
gave a higher contrast than the OIII filter.  Several brighter sections were noted on the close-up 
chart A1 in the U2000 atlas.  One of the brightest pieces is the "neck" of the Pelican located 20'-
25' W of mag 4.8 57 Cygni and collinear with two mag 8/9 stars 10' and 12' due W.  The glow 
extends 10' in length.  To the SW of the mag 4.8 star is the large "beak" section that streams from 
NW to SE and extends roughly 20'x8', widening a bit at the SE end.  The west side of the beak is 
defined by a dark lane that parallels the nebulosity and the large, faint body of the Pelican is west 
of this lane and includes 5.1-magnitude 56 Cygni (the nebulosity is very weak here).  The 
brightest section of the body is a large, circular patch at the south end, ~12' diameter, and located 
30' SE of 56 Cygni and 55' S of the "neck".

18" (9/25/06): This was the first observation of the Pelican Nebula in quite awhile and I forgot 
about this huge, interesting emission nebula.  The view was fascinating at 113x with an OIII or 
UHC filter as this object overfilled the 44' field.  I started exploring to the west of 4.8-magnitude 
57 Cygni.  The brightest section is possibly on a line with this star and a mag 7.2 star further east 
and corresponds with the neck portion on the Pelican.  This is where the ionization front is most 
evident on photographs.  The elongated "beak" of the Pelican also begins to the west of the 
bright star and streams off in a wide river of nebulosity towards the southeast and passing out of 
the field.  A long darker lane apparently free of nebulosity isolates the "neck" from the main 
body of the Pelican.  The irregular body spreads out to the south of the neck well beyond the 
southern edge of the eyepiece field and extends at least 65' from the neck terminating at the SE 
end with a roundish bright patch of nebulosity ~12' in diameter.  The Pelican is located directly 
west of the North American Nebula and part of the same huge complex of nebulosity in this 
region (separated by the dark cloud LDN 935).

13.1" (7/5/83): the entire body of the "Pelican" is easily visible at 62x and a UHC filter.  The 
"head and neck" section is easy to view along with the fainter "bill" and a long body extending 
from head.  Located west of the North America Nebula in a rich field between two mag 7 stars.

semi-circle including a tight quadruple 2' SE.  A scattered group of stars (h2091 = N6991) is 10' 
WSW.

13" (8/25/84): fairly faint, extends generally west of the mag 5.7 star although the border is 
irregular.

8" (8/28/81): mag 6 star surrounded by very faint reflection nebula at low power using a Daystar

thick rim and 30" central hole.  A mag 10.5 star is close off the SSW side (1.8' from the center).

18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x and UHC filter, this beautiful planetary 
appears as a large round ring, nearly 2' diameter, with a bright, thick annulus that is irregularly 
lit.  The rim is slightly brighter and thicker along the SE side and also appeared slightly enhanced 
on the NW side.  The central hole appears 25"-30" diameter and is dark except for a central star 
that was intermittently visible with averted vision at 228x unfiltered, although it is listed with a 
magnitude of 16.5!  Good contrast enhancement with a UHC filter.  A mag 10.5 is off the SSW

surface brightness.  The central "hole" is perhaps 25" in diameter and fairly dark.  A mag 10.5 
star is close off the SSW edge.

17.5" (8/20/88): perfect annular 2' ring visible at 82x using an OIII filter.  A mag 10.5 star is just

superimposed just north of the west end of the galaxy and detracts from viewing.  With averted

relatively prominent.  Gradually concentrated to a brighter 45" core.
