          <p>On December 28, 2013 (Saturday) I met Carter Scholz at Lake Sonoma during an unusual stretch of clear, dry winter weather. There were two other participants, Matt Marcus and
          Caroline Scolari. The transparency was predicted by the CSC to be excellent as well as no cloud cover, though the jet stream was running right down the coast, so seeing was expected
          to be poor. But the seeing was fine, especially for the first several hours, though I often kept to 260x. Observing started close to 6:40 and I stopped a little before 1:00, so
          there was a good 6 hours to explore a number of lesser known targets and some eye-candy. I ended up logging about 50 objects and some of the highlights are below.</p>

          <p>B324, a highly luminous hypergiant, is the brightest individual star in M33. It appeared as a mag 15 star at the north edge of <x-dso>IC 142</x-dso>, a luminous HII region to the north of the
          core. Humphreys (1980) classified B324 as an A5-type star but it is considered to be a post-red supergiant on a blue loop to warmer temperatures and eventually a supernova. Globular
          Cluster U49 lies 3.3' NW. It was visible as a very faint mag 16.2 "star". The position was easy to pinpoint as the cluster forms the northern vertex of a right triangle with a mag
          11.3 star (at the right angle) 1.3' S and a mag 13.5 star 1.5' SSE. Visible ~75% of the time once identified. I also looked globular cluster C39 on the southeast end of the galaxy.
          This cluster also appeared as a very faint 16th magnitude "star", which was not visible continuously in soft seeing. Although the listed mag of C39 is a few tenths brighter than
          U49, I didn't find this cluster any brighter.<br></p>

          <p>This trio consists of the 8' physical pair NGC 672 and IC 1727, which reside at a distance of ~25 million l.y., along with NGC 684 (up to 10x the distance). IC 1727 = KTG 8A
          appeared fairly faint, very large, very elongated 3:1 NW-SE, low surface brightness, ~2.5'x0.8' though the outer halo fades into the background gradually so the dimensions are
          difficult to estimate. Contains a slightly brighter "bar" that is extended 4:1 or 5:1 NW-SE, ~45"x10". The halo is more extensive NW of this bar, so the appearance is asymmetric.
          NGC 672 = KTG 8B lies 8' NE and appeared very bright, very large, elongated 5:2 WSW-ENE, mottled appearance. Contains a brighter, elongated "bar" that is slightly angled (roughly
          7:2 E-W) to the major axis of the halo. Slightly brighter "patches" were visible just beyond the bar (on both the east and west side), probably where spiral arms attach to the bar.
          NGC 684, another 34' NE, appeared as a fairly bright, beautiful edge-on 7:1 E-W, 1.8'x0.25', sharply concentrated with a very small, very bright core and a faint stellar
          nucleus.<br></p>

          An extremely faint companion off the SE side (the pair forming <x-dso>VV 54</x-dso>) was not seen. Forms a 2.5' pair with <x-dso>IC 162</x-dso> = VV 55a = Arp 228. IC 162 appeared moderately bright, fairly

          just 1.0' SE is situated just outside the halo, and appeared very faint, small, elongated 2:1 N-S, 24"x12". <x-dso>UGC 1268</x-dso>, 4' N of IC 162, appeared very faint, elongated 5:2 SW-NE, low
          even surface brightness, 30"x12". A mag 12 star just 24" NE detracts from viewing. Located 4' N of IC 162 = Arp 228. Arp placed IC 162 in his category of "concentric rings".<br></p>

          bright elongated core or bar oriented E-W that increases to a small, rounder nucleus. The halo is much fainter and elongated 2:1 NW-SE, ~1.8'x0.9'. The galaxy is bracketed by mag 10

          involved or nearby including a mag 12.5 star off the NW end, 1.4' from center and a mag 13 star at the SSE side, 40" from center. In addition a mag 15 star is at the north edge,

          A mag 15.5 star is at the north edge and perhaps my comment about a faint stellar nucleus refers to this star. The image is from the Carnegie-Irvine Atlas of southern

          very large, elongated 5:2 NW-SE, ~5'x2', with a very asymmetric structure. Contains a very bright, elongated core, ~1.2'x0.5' NW-SE, but with no distinct nucleus. A low contrast
          dust lane cuts through the core unevenly, with the main section on the north side, so the lane initially appears to run parallel to the core on the southwest side. But a fainter,
          elongated section of the core extending NW-SE is just beyond the dust lane on the southwest side. To the southeast of the core, the outer halo is diffuse with a low surface
          brightness and is not aligned with the major axis of the core, extending more towards the east. On the NW side of the core, the halo has a higher and irregular surface brightness
          with a slightly brighter curving arc (arm) along its eastern side.</p>
