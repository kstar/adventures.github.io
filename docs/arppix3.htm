    Galaxy with Irregular Clumps in Canes Venaticii</h3><img src="assets/arp266.jpg" width="50%">
  </center>N4861 = U08098 = M+06-29-003 = Z189-005 = Arp 266 = Mrk 59 = 1 ZW 49 = IC 3961<br>
  13: faint, very elongated SSW-NNE, even low surface brightness. Located between two mag 12 stars at low power. This "star" is slightly nebulous at 166x and a definite nonstellar knot is
  visible at 312x. This HII region is identified as N4861 (and the galaxy as <x-dso>IC 3961</x-dso>) in UGC and CGCG. This is one of the few extragalatic HII regions which responds to OIII filtration.

  13: moderately bright, fairly small, brighter core, elongated SSW-NNE. Forms a fascinating interacting pair with N4490 3.6' SSE of center. Located 30' NW of Beta Canum Venaticorum (V =
  4.3).
  <p>N4490 = U07651 = M+07-26-014 = Z216-008 = Cocoon Galaxy = VV 30 = 3C 272<br>
  13: very bright, striking, elongated 2:1 NW-SE, 6'x3', large bright core is elongated and grainy. A faint arm extends from the NW end in the direction of N4485 3.6' NNW, a small extension
  (arm) at the SE end is suspected.</p>

  17.5: fairly bright, elongated 2:1 SSW-NNE, 1.5'x0.8', fairly high surface brightness, broadly concentrated halo, core appears rounder, no nucleus, mottled texture. This galaxy is slightly
  larger and brighter of a striking interacting pair almost in contact with N3396 at the NNE end 1.6' from center.
  <p>N3396 = U05935 = M+06-24-018 = Z184-019 = Arp 270 = VV 246<br>
  17.5: forms a prominent double system with N3395 almost attached just S of the W end! Moderately bright, very elongated 3:1 WNW-ESE, 1.0'x0.3', brighter along the major axis, sharply
  concentrated with a high surface brightness core.</p>

  13: faint, small, slightly elongated N-S, small faint nucleus. Forms a close interesting pair with N5427 2.3' N. A mag 13.5 star is 0.9' NNE of center directly between the two galaxies.
  <p>N5427 = M-01-36-003 = Arp 271 = VV 21<br>
  13: fairly faint, moderately large, slightly elongated, very diffuse with an almost even surface brightness. Forms a pair with N5426 2.3' S.</p>

  13: faint, small, slightly elongated SSW-NNE. Located 2.6' NW of the center of the remarkable galaxy N4631 and is completely overshadowed by its beauty.
  <p>N4631 = U07865 = M+06-28-020 = Z188-016 = Arp 281<br>
  13: stunning galaxy, very bright, unusually large and interesting edge-on E-W, 15'x1.5'. A bright knot is E of the core and a faint knot is W of core. Appears very mottled along the major
  axis. A mag 13 star is just N of the core. A companion system N4627 lies 2.6' NW of the center.</p>

  17.5: moderately bright, fairly small, edge-on SSW-NNE, 1.0'x0.3'. This object has a bright stellar knot at the NNE end (about 25" from the center) giving an unusual asymmetric appearance!
  First of three striking elongated systems with N3994 3.7' SSE and N3995 3.9' SE.
