      <td height="223">Here are most of my notes for 4 nights (April 4-7) observing 
        with Jimi Lowrey and Howard Banich on Jimi's 48-inch f/4 leviathan at 
        Fort Davis, Texas. On one day we also were treated to an insider's tour 
        of McDonald Observatory with the supervisor Tom Barnes, and were led through 
        all their facilities including the 11-meter (433-inch) HET (Hobbey-Eberly 
        telescope), the 107-inch Harlan Smith telescope and the 82-inch Otto Stuve 
        telescope. Howard was even given the opportunity to rotate the telescope 
        platform on the HET! 
        <p>This is the 6th trip I've made to Jimi's observatory and I skipped 
          taking notes on any objects I previously logged on the 48&quot;. Sizes 
          are eyeball estimates, but separations and some magnitudes are computed 
          using ALADIN or SDSS photometry. Using SDSS photometry, the faintest 
          object I logged was SDSS J100200.73+554247.0 (close to NGC 3079) at 
          V = 18.6 (roughly B = 19.5). The fainter of two globulars (or Ultra-Compact 
          dwarfs) we viewed in M87 has a V magnitude of 18.3 (B = 19.2)</p>

                of the southwest side, though in soft seeing I couldn't see the 
                corresponding extension on the northeast end. PGC 23359 lies 3.0'

              moderately bright, elongated 3:2 SW-NE, 0.3'x0.2', fairly high surface 
              brightness. Extending to the northeast is a large, low surface brightness 
              halo, which appeared irregular and knotty. This offset halo increased 
              the overall size of the galaxy to ~1.2'x0.8'. On the east end of 
              the halo is a nearly stellar 16-17th mag knot [50&quot; ENE of the 
              core]. A second low surface brightness knot is at the northeast 
              tip [1.0' NE of the core]. A third very low contrast knot is 40&quot; 
              NE of the core. The SDSS image reveals these are the brightest of 
              a large number of blue knots. PGC 1677429 lies 2.6' NE.</td>

              WNW-ESE, 8'x4'. Contains a large, intense, mottled core that increases 
              to a small, brilliant nucleus. At 375x, the outer halo of this beautiful 
              spiral is resolved into several tightly wrapped spiral arcs that 
              are separated by thin dust lanes. The arm structure is most evident 
              along the south side of the galaxy with the easiest arm at the outer 
              edge, particularly where it separates at the western end. The galaxy 
              extends just beyond a mag 9.3 star at the northwest edge. UGCA 342, 
              possibly a detached section of the outer halo of M63, lies 8' WSW 
              of center and 1.2' S of a mag 10.7 star. It appeared extremely faint, 
              fairly small, elongated 2:1 E-W, 20&quot;x10&quot;, very low surface

              <p>14) M83: During this observation of M83, I focused on the HII 
                regions that light up portions of the remarkable spiral arms that 
                emanate from the 3'x1' central bar. The bar is sharply concentrated 
                with a small, intensely bright, 1' round core. At the northeast 
                end of the bar a high contrast arm begins to sweep counterclockwise 
                along the east side, ending up directly south of the core. Several 
                knotty clumps were visible in the region where the arm is attached. 
                First, at the northeast end of the central bar [1.2' NE of center] 
                is NGC 5236:[dPD 83] 42, a 10&quot; HII knot. This designation 
                is from a 1983 paper by de Vaucouleurs, Pence and Davoust that 
                includes a map of the 60 brightest HII regions. Close east of 
                this knot is #46, a 20&quot;x10&quot; elongated patch, situated 
                where the arm begins to unfurl to the south [1.7' NE of center]. 
                HII region #54 is another 12&quot; knot a bit further southeast 
                [0.6'] along the arm [1.9' ENE of center].<br>
                <br>
                On the opposite southwest end of the bar a prominent second arm 
                emerges and spirals out counterclockwise along the west side of 
                the galaxy heading north and then spreading out as it curves east. 
                The arm dims noticeably on the northeast side of the halo near 
                a mag 13 star and has a low surface brightness as it continues 
                south in the outer halo, heading towards h 4599, an 8&quot; pair 
                of mag 8.2/10.7 stars. Several knots are visible in this arm. 
                As the arm emerges at the southwest end is #22 and #18, a small 
                10&quot; knot [1.8' SW of center]. Close north is an elongated 
                clump [2.0' WSW of center], ~25&quot;x10&quot;, containing #13 
                and #15. Another elongated patch, 30&quot;x10&quot;, containing 
                #12 and #16, is 1' further north along the arm [1.9' WNW of center]. 
                Additional HII regions were visible at the northern side of the 
                arm; #39 and #43 are a close pair of small knots ~2.5' NNE of 
                center. Further east along the arm [3.3' NE of center] is #56, 
                another elongated patch, 20&quot;x10&quot;.<br>
                <br>
                A third, wider and more diffuse arm begins on the south side of 
                the bar. It extends below the brighter arm on the west side, and 
                sweeps more gradually, forming an outer western arm. This arm 
                passes just north of a mag 12 star and ends about 4' W of center 
                at a brighter, elongated patch that includes #2 and #3, as well 
                as a mag 15 star.</p>

                as fairly faint, small, round, 15&quot; diameter, very small bright 
                core. The entire quartet is in a 1' chain! HCG 66B lies 0.3' E, 
                with 66C 0.5' SE and 66D 0.7' SE. MCG +10-19-103 lies 2.3' NW. 
                This galaxy is simlar to HCG 66A, but was not included as a group 
                member. 66B appeared faint, very small, elongated 3:2 NNW-SSE, 
                12&quot;x8&quot;. 66C appeared faint, very small, elongated 2:1

                of this very compact quartet and at the western end of the chain. 
                At 488x it appeared very faint, extremely small, round, 5&quot; 
                diameter. The 4 members were easily resolved at 488x in soft seeing.</p>
