          Here are most of my notes for 4 nights (April 4-7) observing with Jimi Lowrey and Howard Banich on Jimi's 48-inch f/4 leviathan at Fort Davis, Texas. On one day we also were treated
          to an insider's tour of McDonald Observatory with the supervisor Tom Barnes, and were led through all their facilities including the 11-meter (433-inch) HET (Hobbey-Eberly
          telescope), the 107-inch Harlan Smith telescope and the 82-inch Otto Stuve telescope. Howard was even given the opportunity to rotate the telescope platform on the HET!
          <p>This is the 6th trip I've made to Jimi's observatory and I skipped taking notes on any objects I previously logged on the 48". Sizes are eyeball estimates, but separations and
          some magnitudes are computed using ALADIN or SDSS photometry. Using SDSS photometry, the faintest object I logged was <x-dso>SDSS J100200.73+554247.0</x-dso> (close to <x-dso>NGC 3079</x-dso>) at V = 18.6
          (roughly B = 19.5). The fainter of two globulars (or Ultra-Compact dwarfs) we viewed in <x-dso>M87</x-dso> has a V magnitude of 18.3 (B = 19.2)</p>

                side, ending up directly south of the core. Several knotty clumps were visible in the region where the arm is attached. First, at the northeast end of the central bar [1.2' NE
                of center] is <x-dso>NGC 5236</x-dso>:[dPD 83] 42, a 10" HII knot. This designation is from a 1983 paper by de Vaucouleurs, Pence and Davoust that includes a map of the 60 brightest HII
                regions. Close east of this knot is #46, a 20"x10" elongated patch, situated where the arm begins to unfurl to the south [1.7' NE of center]. HII region #54 is another 12"
                knot a bit further southeast [0.6'] along the arm [1.9' ENE of center].<br>
                <br>
                On the opposite southwest end of the bar a prominent second arm emerges and spirals out counterclockwise along the west side of the galaxy heading north and then spreading out
                as it curves east. The arm dims noticeably on the northeast side of the halo near a mag 13 star and has a low surface brightness as it continues south in the outer halo,
                heading towards h 4599, an 8" pair of mag 8.2/10.7 stars. Several knots are visible in this arm. As the arm emerges at the southwest end is #22 and #18, a small 10" knot [1.8'
                SW of center]. Close north is an elongated clump [2.0' WSW of center], ~25"x10", containing #13 and #15. Another elongated patch, 30"x10", containing #12 and #16, is 1'
                further north along the arm [1.9' WNW of center]. Additional HII regions were visible at the northern side of the arm; #39 and #43 are a close pair of small knots ~2.5' NNE of
                center. Further east along the arm [3.3' NE of center] is #56, another elongated patch, 20"x10".<br>
                <br>
                A third, wider and more diffuse arm begins on the south side of the bar. It extends below the brighter arm on the west side, and sweeps more gradually, forming an outer
                western arm. This arm passes just north of a mag 12 star and ends about 4' W of center at a brighter, elongated patch that includes #2 and #3, as well as a mag 15 star.</p>

                <x-dso>HCG 66B</x-dso> lies 0.3' E, with 66C 0.5' SE and 66D 0.7' SE. <x-dso>MCG +10-19-103</x-dso> lies 2.3' NW. This galaxy is simlar to <x-dso>HCG 66A</x-dso>, but was not included as a group member. 66B appeared
                faint, very small, elongated 3:2 NNW-SSE, 12"x8". 66C appeared faint, very small, elongated 2:1 N-S, 10"x5". 66D is the smallest and faintest member of this very compact
                quartet and at the western end of the chain. At 488x it appeared very faint, extremely small, round, 5" diameter. The 4 members were easily resolved at 488x in soft
                seeing.</p>
