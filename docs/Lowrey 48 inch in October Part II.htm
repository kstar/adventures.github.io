            The second night in the Davis mountains of West Texas turned out to 
            be a short one as clouds rolled in before midnight. Jimi, Howard Banich 
            and I took turns selected interesting targets in Pegasus and Aquarius 
            to view, including several Arps, as these often display fascinating 
            structure in the monster scope. Except for the Adam Block image, the 
            rest are courtesy of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p align="left">As you might expect to reach the eyepiece on a scope 
            with a 16 foot focal length (4880 mm), it requires one tall ladder 
            (14-ft tripod style). Although the height is quite dizzying at the 
            top during the daytime, at night we just scamper up and down repeatedly!</p>

          Interacting Triple in Aquarius</p>
        <p align="left">Arp 314 is an interacting triplet in Aquarius at a distance 
          of ~160 million light years. I had previously viewed the brightest two 
          members in my 18-inch &#151; MCG -1-58-9 and MCG -1-58-10 &#151; but 
          wanted to view the strange integral-shaped bar of MCG -1-58-11. The 
          trio was observed at 542x.</p>
        <p>MCG -01-58-009 appeared very bright, elongated 4:3 SW-NE, ~50&quot;x35&quot;, 
          strong concentration with a bright elongated core and a &quot;wooly&quot; 
          halo containing slightly brighter patches. MCG -01-58-010 was also bright 
          and a similar size, but slightly fainter. It also sported a small bright 
          core offset slightly to the east side with subtle structure in the halo. 
          Even in the 48&#148;, MCG -01-58-011 was just a very thin, low surface 
          brightness streak oriented ~N-S, ~25&#148; length and ~4&#148; wide. 
          It&#146;s very low surface brightness halo wasn&#146;t noticed.</p>

        <p align="left">William Herschel discovered NGC 7678 in September 1784 
          and called it &#147;Faint, pretty large, bright middle, elliptical, 
          between an acute triangle of pretty considerable stars.&quot; Spiral 
          structure was first reported using Lord Rosse&#146;s 72&#148; Leviathan 
          in November of 1850 and the sketch below, published in 1861, matches 
          the general shape in the SDSS image. Halton Arp placed it in his category 
          of &quot;spiral galaxies with one heavy arm&#148;, which I assume he 
          meant the one that sweeps west (towards the left) below the core. This 
          arm is evident visually in my 24&#148;. The galaxy hosted 3 known supernovae 
          in a 12 year stretch &#151; type-Ib SN 1997dc, type-Ia SN 2002dp and 
          type II-P SN 2009ga.</p>

        <p align="left">In the 48&#148; I logged a small bright core and an extremely 
          bright, very small nucleus containing a pinpoint stellar peak. The core 
          was elongated WNW-ESE and appears as a weak bar. A bright thin arm was 
          nearly attached on the east side of the &quot;bar&quot; and it swung 
          counterclockwise to the south of the core. This arm was sharply defined 
          and brightened significantly on the southwest end. The northern arm 
          was only visible at its root near the west end of the &quot;bar&quot; 
          as well as a small, detached piece on the northeast side of the halo. 
          This observation was made in good seeing but through thin clouds.</p>

        <p align="left">This Pegasus duo (just north of the Great Square) is a 
          smaller and fainter version of the famed M51 pair. The companion galaxy 
          NGC 7752 is currently experiencing a galaxy-wide starburst due to the 
          interaction. The H II regions in NGC 7752 have higher star formation 
          rates than those in NGC 7753 and the stellar populations in NGC 7752 
          are on the order of ~10 &#150; 100 million years. NGC 7753, a type SAB(rs)bc 
          galaxy, has experienced 4 known supernovae, all in a relatively short 
          period of time. SN 2006A discovered in Jan 2006. SN 2006ch, a Type Ia 
          supernova, was discovered 4 months later. In January 2013, SN 2013Q, 
          another Type Ia supernova was found and the Type II supernova, SN 2015ae, 
          was detected in August 2015. A spectacular Spitzer infrared image of 
          NGC 7753, resolving a large number of star-forming regions, is at <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA23006">www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA23006</a>. 
          Redshift-independent estimates vary wildly from 80 million l.y. to over 
          200 million l.y., but the redshift (z = .017) implies a light-travel 
          time of 213 million years.</p>
        <p>Overall, the main body of NGC 7753 appeared 2' diameter (slightly elongated 
          SW-NE), but the tidally stretched arm that wrapped towards NGC 7752 
          increased the length to at least 2.6&#146;. The central portion was 
          strongly concentrated with a bright core that increased to an intense 
          nucleus. A faint star (mag 16.5?) was visible close southwest of the 
          nucleus.</p>
        <p>A spiral arm was connected to the east side of the core, though it 
          wasn't initially separated from the central region. The arm rotated 
          sharply clockwise to the north, and was well defined as it passed directly 
          through a mag 15 star on the north side of the halo. The arm faded as 
          it separated away from the center and gradually curved south on the 
          west side of the galaxy. The arm faded out just east of a mag 16.9 star 
          [1.7' SW of center], before reaching companion NGC 7752, 2.0' SW of 
          center.</p>
        <p>The southern spiral arm emerged from the east or northeast side of 
          the core. It curled tightly clockwise to the south and passed barely 
          inside a mag 14.5 star. The arm was brightest in a strip near this star 
          and then faded as it rotated to the east side of the galaxy.</p>

        <p align="left">UGC 12281 is a superthin galaxy - a classification introduced 
          in 1981 by astronomers Jean Goad and Morton Roberts. These very late-type 
          spirals (Sc or Sd types) are bulgeless galaxies seen perfectly edge-on 
          and display axial ratios from 9:1 to 20:1 Typically they have very low 
          surface brightness, which also implies a low star formation rate. But 
          UGC 12281 is a bit of an enigma as a it has a remarkable amount of current 
          star formation. A recent study suggests an interaction with a nearby 
          dwarf companion may have triggered this result. I&#146;ve previously 
          observed this phantom streak with my 24&#148; from Grandview Campground 
          in the White Mountains and even glimpsed it with my 18&#148; on a superb 
          night at Lassen.</p>
        <p>In the 48&#148; it was a faint, low surface brightness sliver, very 
          large, ~12:1 SSW-NNE, with a length close to 2.5&#146;. The central 
          region was slightly brighter but there no sign of a core or nucleus. 
          2MASX J22591450+1336423, an extremely faint galaxy (V = 17.8) at the 
          eastern flank on the north side [actually an overlap of two galaxies!], 
          was suspected in windy conditions, though Jimi felt it appeared as a 
          bulge at that location.</p>

        <p align="left">This Arp is another William Herschel discovery with quite 
          an unusual appearance due to two apparently intersection dust lanes 
          at nearly a right angle. The chain of dust features is a possible indication 
          this is a polar ring galaxy. A 2008 study found a &quot;subsystem of 
          ionized gas located at a galactocentric distance of r = 2 to 6 kpc and 
          consists of isolated HII regions whose orbits are tilted by significant 
          angles to the stellar disk. Our own and published data on the kinematics 
          of molecular, ionized, and neutral gas can be explained in terms of 
          the following model. Most of the HI mass in the outer parts of the galaxy 
          concentrates in a broad ring with radius of about 20 kpc.&#148;</p>
        <p>A total of 8 visual observations were made through Lord Rosse&#146;s 
          72&#148;, mostly commenting on the irregular surface brightness. One 
          the descriptions reads &quot;&quot;south edge certainly brighter than 
          the other, and a star or nucleus near that side, perhaps very faint 
          nebulosity outside the south edge&#148;. If you examine the SDSS image 
          above, you see the &#147;very faint nebulosity outside the south edge&#148; 
          is a section that is below a prominent dust lane.</p>
        <p>In the 48&#148; this was a prominent galaxy highlighted by a very bright, 
          slightly elongated or oval core. A low contrast dust lane wrapped along 
          the eastern edge of the core around to the south. The dust lane continued 
          to slice through the galaxy towards the west, cutting off a southern 
          piece of the galaxy, which appears like a broad spiral arm. A slightly 
          brighter knot or patch is at the east end of this section, about 20&quot; 
          south of center. The outer halo was slightly fainter on the southeast 
          side.</p>
