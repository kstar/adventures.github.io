  <p>Seyfert's Sextet (Hickson 79 in Serpens) was actually discovered visually by Edouard Stephan, director of the Marseilles Observatory, in June of 1882 using an 80-cm (31.5-inch)
  reflector. Even in this large scope Stephan's description reads "Excess, excess, faible" and he logged it as one entry. This object received a single NGC designation 6027, but in 1951 Carl
  Seyfert discovered it was an extremely compact galaxy on a Harvard Schmidt plate.</p>
  <p>A stunning photo taken with the 200" on Mt. Palomar can be found in Burnham's Celestial Handbook and the group is resolved into 6 components squeezed into a mere 2 arc minutes of sky!
  Interestingly, Stephan also mentions in his observation that "ï¿½very faint star involved, two very faint stars near." This suggests to me that Stephan may have unknowingly resolved several
  members but was fooled by their virtually stellar appearance.</p>
  <p>Actually, one of Seyfert's Sextet is likely a tidally distorted plume of <x-dso>NGC 6027</x-dso> and both components received the single Hickson entry 79b. In addition, 79d has a discordant redshift
  three times the other members and is likely a background object. Still, the average 3-dimensional separation of the members is extremely small and this is a more compact group than
  Stephan's Quintet. You can find Seyfert's Sextet northeast of the distinctive asterism of stars forming the head of Serpens.</p>
  <p>On first glance at 100x, a small, confused glow is visible in my 17.5". Upping the power to 220x, details start to emerge. The brightest member, 79b is a small, dim glow, elongated
  east-west. Just 0.6' south-southwest is the barely nonstellar knot 79a. Finally, a third member, 79c, was just glimpsed with averted vision a mere 0.3' west of 79b. I failed to reveal any
  additional members although at 16th magnitude 79d and 79e should prove quite a challenge in any scope. I'd recommend using at least 200X with a 12.5" or larger scope on this group as the
  three galaxies described above are separated by less that 1 arc minute! - Steve Gottlieb</p>
