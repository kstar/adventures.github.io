          <p>On Saturday, September 7th, after a warm clear day at the beach south of Santa Cruz, I headed out in the late afternoon for Kevin's Ritschel's Deep Sky Ranch. The hour and half
          drive took me through fields of strawberry near Watsonville and Pajaro, farmlands around San Juan Bautista, ranches surrounding Hollister and Tres Pinos and finally a winding canyon
          road in the Diablo Range east of Paicines. As it turned out, I arrived at the property gate at the exact same time as Mark Johnston and Richard Navarette, and we were greeted by
          Kevin.</p>
          <p>Nighttime conditions were just about ideal -- the temperature was warm enough that even a light jacket was unnecessary for the few hours, completely calm, no dew and clear, dark
          skies down to the horizon. Transparency was a bit off from ideal, due to residual smoke in the air but dark enough to dive right into faint Abell planetary and Palomar Globulars as
          soon as it was dark at 9:00. Here were some of the highlights with my 24-inch f/3.7 Starstructure, along with images from the DSS (combined blue/red for color). I've previously
          observed all of these objects multiple times over the past 30 years, first with a 13-inch and later 18-inch scopes. But every increase in aperture brings additional details and
          resolution, so in this sense they all appeared new and exciting. I ended the night after 3:00 AM, with some eye-candy galaxies, one of which I've included at the end.</p>

            At 200x, Palomar 7 appeared as a fairly faint to moderately bright, roundish glow, ~3' diameter, with a weak concentration. Grows in size with averted vision to at least 3.5'
            diameter. At 375x, a total of 8-10 stars were resolved with a couple of additional stars occasionally popping. The brightest is a mag 13-13.5 star on the west side with a mag 14
            star 35" E. A few additional stars appear to be ~15-15.5 magnitude with the remainder closer to 16th magnitude. A mag 10.6 star is 3' NNE of center.</p>

          At 200x this relatively bright Palomar globular contained a brighter core and a roundish halo ~2.5' diameter, with several mag 15 and fainter stars resolved. Well resolved at 375x
          and 500x into roughly two dozen mag 15/16 (several extremely faint) stars resolved in addition to 5 brighter mag 14.5-15 stars. The resolved stars are distributed over the entire
          glow, though more concentrated in the 1' core that is slightly elongated SW to NE. Situated 4' SE of mag 8.6 <x-dso>HD 186496</x-dso> with several brighter mag 12-13 stars scattered outside the

          Easily visible continuously at 200x using a NPB filter, as a round, 1' well-defined disc with a low surface brightness. The 15th magnitude central star was visible even with the
          filter and a slightly fainter star was just off the east side [44" from center]. Abell 46 is slightly weaker on the south side, and this often created the impression that the
          planetary was slightly elongated E-W. Without a filter, the planetary was a very faintly glow surrounding a 15th mag star, and set in a rich star field.</p>

          At 200x using an NPB filter, Abell 53 appeared faint, fairly small, round, 25-30" diameter. Could hold steadily a fairly crisp disc with a low surface brightness. An extremely faint
          glow was visible part of the time unfiltered. ?2446, a bright 10" pair of mag 7/9 stars lies 17' NW.</p>

          Using an OIII and NPB filter at 200x, Abell 55 appeared relatively bright, moderately large, slightly elongated SW-NE, crisp-edged, ~50" diameter. Excellent contrast gain with a
          filter and easily visible continuously, standing out prominently in the field. Appears slighlty brighter on the north rim, though this may be a faint superimposed star. Easily seen
          unfiltered, though the field is very rich in faint stars and unresolved background glow, so Abell 55 doesn't stand out nearly as well. Several faint stars are either superimposed or
          barely off the edges.</p>

          Best view was at 200x using an OIII filter. Abell 62 appeared as a faint, roundish glow, ~2' diameter. Several stars are involved around the edges including a mag 12 star at the NE
          edge. Slightly brighter along along the south rim, near a superimposed mag 12.5/14.1 pair at ~10". Also, slightly brighter or better defined along the west side, where there is a
          mag 10 star just off the NW edge. The north and east side of the planetary has a more ill-defined border. Also viewed with a NPB filter, but the OIII gave a better contrast gain.

          Best view at 125x using an OIII filter. Abell 67 was faint, moderately large, round, crisp-edged, low even surface brightness, ~1' diameter. Can hold steadily with averted vision.
          Slightly less contrast using an NPB filter and increasing the mag to 200x lowers the surface brightness too much.</p>

          brightened along the western side and the interior seemed slightly darker, giving a strong impression of annularity. At 200x, several faint superimposed stars, including the central

          57, a slightly brighter HII knot, that appears as an extremely faint "soft" star.</p>
