      <td>Third day at Lassen National Park. 
        <p>During the late morning Mark Wagner and I spotted a very thin crescent 
          moon (just over a day old) as well as Venus naked-eye to the west of 
          the Sun. In the clear mountain air at high elevation, neither was difficult. 
          Afterwards, we took an exhilirating hike to one of the nearby lakes. 
          Once we climbed out of the Summit Lake basin, there was hardly anyone 
          on the trail and it felt like we had the park practically to ourselves. 
          Here's the view looking back at Mt Lassen as well as the spot we stopped 
          along the lake. In the early evening Mark and I were invited over again 
          to the Lowrey's camping site for dinner and shared good food and wine.

        <p></p>
        <p>In the evening, we set up once again at the Bumpass Hell lot. The wind 
          was less of a factor, so I was able to push the magnification up as 
          high as 1000x on high surface brightness objects. Mostly I stuck with 
          interesting galaxy pairs and groups, but also looked at a few planetaries, 
          globulars and and a young star, still involved with gas and dust.</p>

          Size: 30&quot;x26&quot;; Mag: 7.8
          <p align="left">The Saturn Nebula was viewed at 1000x in good seeing. 
            The intense, inner annulus is 30&quot;x18&quot; with a bright, moderately 
            thick green rim and darker center. The central star was nearly visible 
            steadily within the darker center. The oval annulus was slightly irregular 
            in surface brightness. It was surrounded by a rounder, fainter envelope, 
            which varied slightly in brightness, particularly on the north side 
            which contained a noticeable knot. The fairly narrow ansae were readily 
            visible, though brighter on the west side. The western ansae contained 
            an obvious knot at the end, which was slightly elongated. The eastern 
            ansae only had a weak brightening at the tip.</p>

            Size: 2.1'; Mag: 14.7V</p>
          <p align="left">Discovered by Sidney van den Bergh in 1958 by inspection 
            of the POSS and confirmed as a globular by Halton Arp using the Palomar 
            200&quot;. The discovery announcement &quot;A New Faint Globular Cluster&quot; 
            is at http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1960PASP...72...48A. 
            The brightest confirmed individual stars are mag 17.6.</p>
          <p align="left">In my 24&quot; it appeared as a very faint glow, fairly 
            small, roughly 1.5' diameter, very low surface brightness with an 
            ill-defined halo. The cluster is roughly centered 1' south of a mag 
            12.4 star, and a mag 14 star is very close to the center. The halo 
            appears to reach the mag 12.5 star.</p>

            Size: 0.2'x0.2'; Mag: 15.3B</p>
          <p align="left">The NGC 6074 contact pair was nearly tangent at 260x 
            and barely resolved at 375x. The brighter component, MCG +02-41-016, 
            is on the north end and appeared faint, very small, round, 12&quot; 
            diameter. The fainter component, MCG +02-41-016, is attached at the 
            south-southwest end (just 15&quot; between centers!) and was very 
            faint, round, 9&quot; diameter. Located 1.0' ENE of a mag 11.9 star. 
            NGC 6078, another close double system, lies 12' ESE. In addition, 
            2MFGC 13014, located 3.7' NE (outside the field of the image), appeared 
            extremely faint, small, elongated 2:1 N-S, 15&quot;x8&quot;. At B 
            = 17.3, it required averted vision to glimpse.</p>

          <p align="left">The main component of the NGC 6078 contact pair appeared 
            moderately bright, fairly small, round, 30&quot; diameter, increases 
            to a very small bright core and down to a stellar nucleus. MCG +02-41-018 
            is attached to the south-southeast side, just 25&quot; between centers! 
            The companion appeared faint, very small, round, 12&quot; diameter, 
            occasional stellar nucleus. The pair was just resolved at 260x.</p>

            16 49 11.5 +53 25 11<br>
            Size: 3.5' (entire chain); Mag: 14.6V (brightest member Shkh 16-1)</p>
          <p align="left">I've viewed this chain a number of times since 1999, 
            but it's always a treat with 5 galaxies neatly arranged in a 3.5' 
            chain oriented north-south. In addition, a 6th galaxy in 3' further 
            north. A 9th magnitude star is very close to the east and somewhat 
            of a distraction, so high magnification helps. The members vary in 
            brightness from 15.6B at the bright end (Shkh 16-1) to 17.3B (Shkh 
            16-5) at the faint end. The chain is located in Draco and not very 
            easy to find (the nearest mag 6 star is 2.5 degrees away). Except 
            for Shkh 16-1, which I logged as faint or fairly faint, the other 
            members are all very faint, very small round glows, not much more 
            than 12&quot; in diameter.</p>

          <p align="left">At 375x, this post-merger system appeared fairly faint, 
            fairly small, slightly elongated N-S, 0.4'x0.3'. Strongly concentrated 
            with a very small bright core containing very bright, sharp stellar 
            nucleus. With careful viewing, there was a very strong impression 
            of an extension (tidal plume) extending south. The narrow tidal tail 
            extending northeast on the SDSS image above was not seen. Pretty cool 
            looking galaxy, huh?</p>

          <p align="left">Vorontsov-Velyaminov called this system a &quot;pair 
            of coalescent&quot; galaxies. At 260x, the interacting pair appeared 
            faint, small, elongated 2:1 N-S, 0.4'x0.2'. Increasing the magnification 
            to 375x and 500x, two connected galaxies were visible. The northern 
            member (VV 711 NED1) is larger and elongated 3:2 N-S, ~12&quot;x8&quot;. 
            The southern component (VV 711 NED2) is very faint, round, 8&quot; 
            diameter. There was no clear gap between the two objects and the tail 
            to the north was not seen.<br>

            A mag 14.5 star is off the northwest end. Brightest in a trio with 
            MCG +02-57-006 1.8' ESE (&quot;extremely faint and small, round, 10&quot; 
            diameter&quot;) and CGCG 429-012 2.0' SSW (faint, small, round, 0.3' 
            diameter). This CGCG galaxy may be in the foreground as the catalogued 
            redshift is 1/2 that of the other two galaxies.</p>

          <p align="left">This cometary reflection nebula was picked up at 260x 
            unfiltered, but a better view was using 375x. The &quot;head&quot; 
            of this cometary nebula is the mag 13 star HBC 687 (FU Ori type). 
            It was clearly non-stellar, though only 3&quot;-5&quot; in diameter. 
            The low surface brightness &quot;tail&quot; extends about 30&quot;x10&quot; 
            to the north-northwest and fans very little. HBC 687 is a young pre-main 
            sequence star with a collimated fan (single) and can be found 45' 
            northwest of the planetary nebula NGC 6804. </p>

            12.5 star is 1.3' WNW, collinear with the major axis. A 7&quot; pair 
            of mag 15 stars is barely off the ESE end. NGC 7253B is attached at 
            the ESE end of NGC 7253A, very close to the faint double, and appears 
            very faint, fairly small, elongated 2:1 SW-NE, 30&quot;x15&quot;.
