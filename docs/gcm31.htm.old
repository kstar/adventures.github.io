  <p>With a special opportunity to observe faint deep sky objects in August at the San Francisco State field campus at the Sierra Buttes (2200m elevation), I found myself spending several
  hours exploring one of the most familiar objects in the sky, M31-the great spiral galaxy in Andromeda. Sure, M31 is always worth a look to see its large bright core, immense halo and
  striking dust lanes, but as we view our galactic neighbor only 12.5° from edge-on we unfortunately miss the stunning spiral arms visible in <x-dso>M51</x-dso> and the numerous HII regions of <x-dso>M33</x-dso> seen in a
  large scope. Jim Shields mentioned to me that he had brought along two issues of Deep Sky (#8 and #32) which discussed in detail the globular and open cluster system of M31 and provided
  finder charts for tracking down these obscure objects (similar information can be found in Luginbuhl & Skiff's Observing Handbook) and I immediately knew I had an interesting observing
  project for the week!</p>
  <p>Edwin Hubble, whose pioneering work on the M31 Cepheid variables led to resolving the debate over the nature of the "spiral nebulae", also published the first catalogue of 140 globulars
  in 1932. The globulars he found ranged from 15-18 blue photographic magnitude and 4-10 arcseconds in diameter. At 2.2 million light years, the globulars of M31 are roughly 100 times as
  distant as <x-dso>M13</x-dso> in Hercules and hence are 1 / 10,000 as luminous if placed at a similar distance. This translates into a ten magnitude difference and at 14.3 (visual) magnitude, the
  brightest five globulars in M31 are comparable in absolute magnitude to 4th magnitude Omega Centauri (Mv = -8.5), the brightest within our galaxy.</p>
  <p>As many as 509 globulars in M31 have been catalogued based on spectra plates taken at Mauna Kea with the 3.6 meter Canada-France-Hawaii telescope, (Crampton et al, 1985), although recent
  work indicates that some of these are faint background galaxies. In any case, the M31 globular cluster system does appear to be more numerous than our own galaxy by roughly a 2:1 ratio.
  This important article provides identifications, positions, magnitudes, colors and radii although no finder charts are given.</p>
  <p>As the M31 globulars will appear stellar except for Mayall II, you won't be able to identify the clusters without a good finder chart. Useful photos can be found in the Deep Sky articles
  as well as Paul Hodge's Atlas of the Andromeda Galaxy which contains 41 large scale photographic charts. These should provide ample ammunition for tracking down the M31 globulars with
  10-inch or larger scopes.</p>
  <p>I found it really quite easy to star hop around in the vicinity of M31 as the star fields are not densely packed and very easy to recognize small asterisms on the photos. In fact, most
  globulars were picked up by star hopping at low power (x100 for me) with a 20mm Nagler within a minute or two and then the identification was pinned down at x220 with a 9mm Nagler by
  comparison with a photo. . After three hours working over the field on two nights with my 44cm telescope, I had picked up a dozen globulars as well as five open clusters , three stellar
  associations and of course the giant star cloud <x-dso>NGC 206</x-dso>. It was also clear that I will have to return to M31 again, as I really just started working on the fainter globulars.</p>
  <p>All the globular and open clusters appeared stellar (since I was viewing the brighter core), except Mayall II, although the catalogued dimensions are generally 3-4 arcseconds. I found
  the brightest globulars after Mayall II to be #76, #78 and #280 in Hodge's atlas which had photometrically determined magnitudes of 14.2-14.3V and all were easily visible with direct
  vision. In some cases, two or more globulars are visible in the same field. As you move closer to the core, the globulars are more difficult to pick out as they are reddened by dust and gas
  and lose contrast being superimposed on the brighter glow from the galaxy. The fainter globulars I viewed ranged from 15.0-15.5V and required averted vision, though I was able to confirm
  the sightings after carefully checking the charts. Finally, I also easily tracked down #73, which turns out to be a 15th magnitude stellar globular in <x-dso>M110</x-dso> = NGC 205, the large companion
  galaxy northwest of M31. If you are looking for a challenging observing project with a 30cm or larger scopes, this is a great one for the fall as M31 passes high overhead and it was an
  exciting project to be exploring extragalactic globulars at immense distances.</p>
