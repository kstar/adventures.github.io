  <p>With a special opportunity to observe faint deep sky objects in August at the San Francisco State field campus at the Sierra Buttes (2200m elevation), I found myself spending several
  hours exploring one of the most familiar objects in the sky, M31-the great spiral galaxy in Andromeda. Sure, M31 is always worth a look to see its large bright core, immense halo and
  striking dust lanes, but as we view our galactic neighbor only 12.5° from edge-on we unfortunately miss the stunning spiral arms visible in <x-dso>M51</x-dso> and the numerous HII regions of <x-dso>M33</x-dso> seen in a
  large scope. Jim Shields mentioned to me that he had brought along two issues of Deep Sky (#8 and #32) which discussed in detail the globular and open cluster system of M31 and provided
  finder charts for tracking down these obscure objects (similar information can be found in Luginbuhl & Skiff's Observing Handbook) and I immediately knew I had an interesting observing
  project for the week!</p>
  <p>Edwin Hubble, whose pioneering work on the M31 Cepheid variables led to resolving the debate over the nature of the "spiral nebulae", also published the first catalogue of 140 globulars
  in 1932. The globulars he found ranged from 15-18 blue photographic magnitude and 4-10 arcseconds in diameter. At 2.2 million light years, the globulars of M31 are roughly 100 times as
  distant as <x-dso>M13</x-dso> in Hercules and hence are 1 / 10,000 as luminous if placed at a similar distance. This translates into a ten magnitude difference and at 14.3 (visual) magnitude, the
  brightest five globulars in M31 are comparable in absolute magnitude to 4th magnitude Omega Centauri (Mv = -8.5), the brightest within our galaxy.</p>
  <p>As many as 509 globulars in M31 have been catalogued based on spectra plates taken at Mauna Kea with the 3.6 meter Canada-France-Hawaii telescope, (Crampton et al, 1985), although recent
  work indicates that some of these are faint background galaxies. In any case, the M31 globular cluster system does appear to be more numerous than our own galaxy by roughly a 2:1 ratio.
  This important article provides identifications, positions, magnitudes, colors and radii although no finder charts are given.</p>
  <p>As the M31 globulars will appear stellar except for Mayall II, you won't be able to identify the clusters without a good finder chart. Useful photos can be found in the Deep Sky articles
  as well as Paul Hodge's Atlas of the Andromeda Galaxy which contains 41 large scale photographic charts. These should provide ample ammunition for tracking down the M31 globulars with
  10-inch or larger scopes.</p>
  <p>I found it really quite easy to star hop around in the vicinity of M31 as the star fields are not densely packed and very easy to recognize small asterisms on the photos. In fact, most
  globulars were picked up by star hopping at low power (x100 for me) with a 20mm Nagler within a minute or two and then the identification was pinned down at x220 with a 9mm Nagler by
  comparison with a photo. . After three hours working over the field on two nights with my 44cm telescope, I had picked up a dozen globulars as well as five open clusters , three stellar
  associations and of course the giant star cloud NGC 206. It was also clear that I will have to return to M31 again, as I really just started working on the fainter globulars.</p>
  <p>All the globular and open clusters appeared stellar (since I was viewing the brighter core), except Mayall II, although the catalogued dimensions are generally 3-4 arcseconds. I found
  the brightest globulars after Mayall II to be #76, #78 and #280 in Hodge's atlas which had photometrically determined magnitudes of 14.2-14.3V and all were easily visible with direct
  vision. In some cases, two or more globulars are visible in the same field. As you move closer to the core, the globulars are more difficult to pick out as they are reddened by dust and gas
  and lose contrast being superimposed on the brighter glow from the galaxy. The fainter globulars I viewed ranged from 15.0-15.5V and required averted vision, though I was able to confirm
  the sightings after carefully checking the charts. Finally, I also easily tracked down #73, which turns out to be a 15th magnitude stellar globular in <x-dso>M110</x-dso> = NGC 205, the large companion
  galaxy northwest of M31. If you are looking for a challenging observing project with a 30cm or larger scopes, this is a great one for the fall as M31 passes high overhead and it was an
  exciting project to be exploring extragalactic globulars at immense distances.</p>

  00 42 18.9 +41 14 02<br>
  V = 15.2; Size 2.9"<br>
  18" (9/20/03): extremely difficult observation as this M31 globular is situated only 5' SW of the center of the core of M31! Glimpsed several times at the correct position. A few other very
  faint stars (not plotted on the GSC) in the vicinity were also glimpsed intermittently.<br></p>
  <p>M31-G144 = <x-dso>Bol 082</x-dso><br>
  00 42 16.0 +41 01 15<br>
  V = 15.5; Size 2.8"<br>
  18" (9/20/03): this extremely faint M31 globular required averted vision and could not hold continuously. Located 2' N of a pair of mag 12.5/13 stars. The observation is hampered by the
  bright background glow of M31. Located 10' NW of the center of M32 and just 16' SSW of the center of M31! More difficult G144 is located 13' N near the core itself.<br></p>

  east edge of the main portion of the halo. At 450x, G213 appears quasi-stellar with a tiny fuzzy disc perhaps 2"-3" in diameter. With direct vision a stellar nucleus is sometimes visible or
  the very small halo simply fades out.<br></p>
  <p>M31-G219 = Mayall IV = <x-dso>Bol 358</x-dso><br>
  00 43 17.8 +39 49 13<br>

  00 43 31.1 +41 18 15<br>
  V = 15.4; Size 2.9"<br>
  18" (12/10/07): difficult mag 15.5 "star" located 2.8' NNE of G222. Only visible 15-20% of the time at 260x in soft seeing but observation repeatable in the same position. Should be an
  easier object in good seeing conditions.<br></p>

  V = 15.5; Size 2.5"<br>
  18" (12/10/07): appears as a very faint mag 15 "star". Located 2.3' SE of G222 and collinear with G222 and two stars 1' and 2' further WNW of G222. At 220x, these two objects are similar in
  brightness and have a softer appearance is comparison to nearby faint stars (perhaps 1.5"-2" in diameter).<br></p>
  <p>M31-G244 = <x-dso>Bol 193</x-dso><br>
  00 43 45.7 +41 36 58<br>
  V = 15.3; Size 2.6"<br>
  17.5" (8/18/93): extremely faint, appears as a mag 15.5 "star". Cannot hold continuously but easy to locate just 1.5' S of distinctive line of three equally spaced mag 13 stars of 2'

  V = 15.1; Size 5.7"<br>
  18" (12/8/07): faint but easily visible non-stellar M31 cluster at 300x. Appears very small, ~10"x5", elongated ~N-S and could be mistaken for a distant, faint galaxy. Located 8' due south
  of the starcloud NGC 206 and forms a right angle with G76 5.5' E.<br></p>
  <p><x-dso simbad="KHM31 96">M31-C205</x-dso><br>
  00 40 55.0 +41 03 03<br>
  18" (12/10/07): not initially noticed at 220x, but with careful averted vision I could pick up a very low surface brightness spot, ~20" in diameter with no concentration. Slightly easier at
  260x and visible ~50% of the time with averted. The core of this object was catalogued as an emission-line object and is listed in SIMBAD as MLA 285.<br></p>
  <p><x-dso simbad="KHM31 168">M31-C202</x-dso><br>
  00 42.1 +40 57<br>
  17.5" (8/17/93): faint, extremely small, about 6" diameter. Easily visible as the slightly fainter southern member of a very close nebulous pair with M31-C203 15" N. Just cleanly resolved
  at 220x. Located SW of the core of M31 and 9' NW of M32 within association M31-A24.<br></p>
  <p><x-dso simbad="KHM31 167">M31-C203</x-dso><br>
  00 42 09.1 +40 57 30<br>
  17.5" (8/17/93): faint, extremely small but nonstellar, about 6" diameter. Easily seen as the slightly brighter northern member of a very close nebulous pair with M31-C202 15" S, just
  resolved at 220x. A mag 9.3 star lies 5' E. Located SW of the core of M31 and involved in association M31-A24.<br></p>
  <p><x-dso simbad="[H81] B-410">M31-C410</x-dso><br>
  00 44 22.0 +41 20 30<br>
  18" (11/13/07): this unusual M31 "cluster" appeared a faint, elongated glow nearly 3:1 N-S, ~20"x8". Situated in the middle between the relatively bright globular G280 1.2' NE and G272 2.4'
  SW. C410 is the brightest object with the association A33.<br></p>

  00 44.7 +41 26.5<br>
  18" (11/13/07): appears a small, hazy patch, ~15" diameter. Located just south of a 50" pair of mag 12 stars. Consists of clusters C284, C285 and C286.<br></p>
  <p>M31-C406 = <x-dso simbad="[V64] 41">M31-A41</x-dso><br>
  00 44.8 +41 29<br>
  18" (12/8/07): very faint hazy glow, small, 15"-20" diameter. Requires averted to see due to low surface brightness, but can nearly hold steadily with averted vision and concentration. One
  or two extremely faint stars or stellar M31 clusters are involved.<br></p>
  <p>M31-C306 = <x-dso simbad="[V64] 42">M31-A42</x-dso><br>
  00 44 55 +41 31.4<br>
  18" (12/8/07): marginal low surface brightness glow involved along the south side of a group of mag 13-14 "stars", ~30" diameter but very ill defined. It's possible the mag 13-14 stars that
  I noted are stellar cores of clusters, but are more likely Milky Way stars.<br></p>
  <p><x-dso simbad="[JSD2015] AP 2681">M31-C312</x-dso><br>
  00 45.2 +41 37<br>
  17.5" (8/17/93): extremely faint, very small, elongated glow requiring averted. Located 2' N of a line connecting two mag 12/13 stars oriented WNW-ESE with separation 6'. Situated along the
  eastern edge of the NE extension and close to the sharp light cut-off of M31 with the background sky to the E. Probably glimpsed the unresolved glow of C311, C312, C313 with a total length
  of 1.5'.<br>
