V = 12.8;  Size 1.6x1.2;  Surf Br = 13.5;  PA = 120d

17.5" (11/14/87): moderately bright, slightly elongated ~E-W, bright core, stellar nucleus.  
Forms a pair with NGC 2 just 1.8' S.  The two galaxies are not physically related, with NGC 2 in 
the background.

17.5" (9/19/87): fairly faint, oval 3:2 ~E-W, small, bright core, stellar nucleus.  A mag 12 star 
lies 1.9' NNE and a mag 13 star is 1.5' NNW of center.

13" (8/24/84): fairly faint, very small, small bright core.

13" (11/5/83): faint, very small.  Forms a pair with NGC 2 2' SSE.

18" (10/21/06): faint, very small, elongated 3:2 WNW-ESE, 0.4'x0.25', very small slightly 
brighter core, faint stellar nucleus with direct vision.  A mag 11.5 star lies 1.2' SW.  Brightest in 
a group of faint galaxies.

17.5" (8/2/86): fairly faint, small, bright core, slightly elongated.  A mag 11.5 star is 1.2' WSW.  
Brightest in the NGC 3 group with NGC 7838 6.3' NW, NGC 7837 6.9' NW, N7835 10' NW, 
N7834 11' WNW and NGC 4 5' NNE.

NGC 0004 = PGC 212468

V = 15.9;  Size 0.4x0.2;  Surf Br = 13.0;  PA = 30d

18" (10/21/06): extremely faint and small, round.  This threshold object appeared virtually 
stellar,  perhaps 4" diameter and only visible occasionally with averted vision.  Located 3' due 
west of a mag 9 star.  Another very difficult galaxy, NGC 7840, lies 4' WNW.

17.5" (8/2/86): faintest member of the NGC 3 group.  Extremely faint and small, at visual 
threshold.  Located 2.9' W of mag 9 SAO 109022 and 4.8' NNE of NGC 3.  Incorrect 
identification in the RNGC.

With respect to NGC 3 (also discovered on the same night) Marth placed this object 10 tsec of 
RA following and 5' N.  RNGC identifies NGC 4 with an anonymous galaxy (NPM1G 
+07.0004) situated 15' southeast of NGC 3, clearly an incorrect match.

At Marth's original position, 4.7' NNE of NGC 3, is an extremely faint galaxy which I was just 
able to glimpse with my 17.5" at 220x, a few arc minutes preceding a brighter star.  Harold 
Corwin gives a precise 2000 position for NGC 4 at 00 07 24.4 +08 22 23.  This galaxy is not in 
RC 3, CGCG, MCG.

See observing notes for NGC 20.

Found by Swift (List #2 on 20 Sept 1885) but his position was 1.1 tmin W and 47' S of NGC 20 
= U00084 = M+05-01-036 = CGCG 498-082.  His RA offset is identical to the error in his 
positions for N19, N21, N7831, N7836 also found the same evening.  Although the dec error is 
large, his description ("one of 5 st which point to it is p nr") matches the chain of five stars just 
following N20, whose position was accurately given by Schultz.  The RNGC lists NGC 6 as 
nonexistent but incorrectly equates it with N7831.  See NGCBUGS for more info.

Discovered by WH (IV 15) although his RA was 1m 20s following UGC 80.  This galaxy was 
possibly recorded by JH as h5 ("a star 15m with a burr, RA from Cat.") and again listed as GC 
12, although JH mentioned that d'Arrest noted the position of h5 was in error.  In the NGC, 
Dreyer equates h4 (at the correct place) with IV 15 = h5.  JH's description of h5, though, is quite 
odd and doesn't appear to apply to this relatively bright galaxy.  So, possibly IV 15 = h4 only.

Discovered by Muller (list II).  Not found by Bigourdan. Noted as equivalent to NGC 34 by 
Howe (Mon. Not. LXI and repeated in IC II Notes and Corrections section) as well as by 
Corwin.  In this case Muller's RA was 2.0 tmin too small (typical error from the Leander-
McCormick observatory).  There is also a close double star 2' W of this galaxy which matches 
Muller's description for N17 ("D* 2'p.")

17.5" (10/17/87): faint, fairly small, slightly elongated SW-NE, diffuse.  A mag 15 star is 1' W.  
Located 9' S of mag 6.8 SAO 53694.  This galaxy is misidentified as N0021 in RNGC and UGC 
and N0019 is listed as nonexistent in RNGC.

Discovered by Swift on 20 Sept 1885 (list II).  Described as "in center of 3 vF st forming an 
equilateral triangle, two of them double."  There is no obvious candidate visible on the GSC at 
Swift's position but his positions for four of the gx's discovered that night (NGC's 19, 21, 7831, 
7836) have systematic offsets of 1.2 tmin too far W and 8' too far S.  When this offset is applied 
to NGC 19 it points to U00098 = M+05-01-046 = CGCG 499-065.  Futhermore, his description 
of the surrounding stars matches this galaxy.

U00098 is misidentified as NGC 21 in RNGC and UGC and not assigned a NGC designation in 
MCG and CGCG.  Finally, RNGC lists NGC 19 as nonexistent because of the error in Swift's 
position.

is just 30" E and a brighter mag 10 star lies 2.4' E.  Second of three with NGC 13 12' NW.

Schultz's micrometric position for NGC 20 matches U00084 = M+05-01-036 = CGCG 498-082.  
Swift later (20 Sept 1885) entered this galaxy in List #2 (NGC 6) but his position was 1.1 tmin 
too far W and 47' too far S.  His RA offset is identical to the error in his positions for N19, N21, 
N7831, N7836 all found the same evening.  Although the dec error is large, his description ("one 
of 5 st which point to it is p nr") matches the chain of 5 stars just following.

See observing notes for NGC 29.

Lewis Swift recorded NGC 21 (List #2) on 20 Sept 1885 but his positions for N19, N21, N7831 
and N7836 from the same evening are all offset 1m 10s in RA.  Applying this offset to Swift's 
position for N21 falls precisely on N29 = U00100 = M+05-01-048 = CGCG 499-066 which was 
discovered by Schultz and given a precise micrometric position.  N19 is identified as N21 in 
RNGC and UGC.

17.5" (12/30/99): at 100x appeared (unfiltered) as a slightly elongated, moderately bright disc 
surrounding a bright mag 11.5 central star. A slightly fainter mag 12 star lies 1.0' SW.  This is a 
low excitation PN with an OIII/H-beta ratio of just 0.4 and at 100x there was a noticeable 
enhancement using the H-beta filter while it dimmed with an OIII.  At 220x, a star was 
intermittently visible at the SW edge and the PN was slightly elongated SSW-NNE.  The best 
filter response with this power was using the UHC.  The surface brightness appeared irregular -- 
darker around the central star and slightly brighter along the west and east side of the rim.  At 
280x, the faint star I had noted earlier was barely off the SW edge and the PN was weakly 
annular with a brighter rim along the west and east side and a darker center.  The SW and NE 
ends of the halo were clearly weaker, though.  380x provided a nice view with subtle 
irregularities in the interior.

17.5" (11/1/86): bright, moderately large, round.  Contains a prominent mag 11.5 central star 
surrounded by a fairly bright halo.

13" (12/7/85): at 166x, bright central star visible centered within a fairly small prominent disc.

13" (10/12/85): moderately large, bright central star surrounded by a moderately bright halo at 
166x-214x using a UHC filter.

8": the bright central star is surrounded by an easy halo.

15x50 IS binoculars (10/21/06): although very low in the southern sky, visible as a faint,

20" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): viewed at nearly 60° elevation at 212x, this huge 
galaxy was an amazing sight and overfilled the 23' field (at least 25' in length).  Near the core 
were two small, prominent HII knots.  A couple of additional low surface brightness knots were

Discovered by Swift (V) in a trio with NGC 50 and NGC 54.  Howe failed twice to find this 
object and it is probably identical to NGC 47 (discovered ealier by Tempel).  This would require 
Swift's RA for NGC 58 to be 1 tmin too large but his description of a "wide D[ouble] star nr sp" 
applies to NGC 47 making this equivalence very likely.  See NGCBUGS for full story.

04-02-003.

17.5" (10/21/95): not seen, though viewed through thin clouds.

Discovered by Frank Muller using the 26" refractor at Leander-McCormick observatory in 
Charlottesville, Virginia.  Although the discovery positions at the observatory were generally 
very imprecise due to poorly calibrated circles, Howe corrected the position to 00h 17.5m -22d 
48m (1950).  Examination of the POSS reveals a small, faint galaxy located precisely at this 
corrected position and this galaxy is identified in the ESO and SGC as N77 = E473-015.

Furthermore, Muller stated a mag 9 star is 2.8' W (in PA 280°) and on the POSS a mag 11 star is 
3.1' WNW in PA 282d.  The RNGC incorrectly identifies N77 as M-04-02-003 which is located 
16' SW of Howe's corrected position.

NGC 77 is not in MCG or RC3 and it appears extremely faint on the POSS.  I incorrectly stated 
that N77 is nonexistent in RNGC Corrections #3.  The situation was correctly sorted out in 
RNGC Corrections #6.

18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at low power (76x using a 27mm Panoptic) the 
blazing core had an unusual, pale yellow hue.

20" f/5 (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this was the best view I had of 47 Tucanae 
during the week.  At 212x, the entire 23' field was packed edge-to-edge with pinpoint stars and 
the blazing, intense core which had a yellowish tint was resolved into a mesmerizing dense mat 
of stars.  The halo extended to at least 30'.  

18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x, this breathtaking globular was viewed 
at over 50° elevation and was stunningly resolved into several thousand stars out to a diameter of 
over 25'.  The star density steadily increases towards the center.  The relatively small 4' core was 
blazing and highly resolved right to the edge of a very small compressed nucleus.  A 3-
dimensional affect was very strong with layers of stars forming a dense mat over the core.  Many 
of the stars in the halo are connected in chains and lanes.  The 9mm Nagler does a better job of 
busting apart the stars in the core, although the cluster overfills the field at this power. The total 
visual magnitude is just slightly fainter than Omega Centauri and the size slightly smaller, but 
certainly equal in visual impact.

12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): While at Bargo, I observed 47 Tucana still very low in the sky 
but an easy 4th magnitude naked-eye blur just west of the SMC.  At 186x, it filled the 26' field 
with an uncountable number of stars.  Strongly concentrated to an intense, blazing core which 
was only partially resolved at a low elevation.  The highly resolved outer halo extends ~25' in an 
irregular outline while the central halo was very symmetric.  This is the most prominent naked-
eye GC as so much of its light is concentrated into the central core and it lies in a sparse field 
with no other rivals other than the SMC.

Dreyer states in Herschel's Scientific Papers that William Herschel's III 323 = h2334 = N175.  
There was a one degree declination error by Carolyn Herschel in the NGC position for N171.  
N171 was not found by Carlson and it is listed as nonexistent in RNGC.  See NGCBUGS for 
story.

17.5" (12/26/00): At 100x, ~75 stars within 10'-12', roundish group.  The cluster is fairly rich but 
unconcentrated with a noticeable void of stars near in the center and a somewhat ill-defined

18" (8/26/06): this double system was just resolved into two very close, small knots, roughly 20" 
each in diameter with their halos in contact.  Both components have faint stellar nuclei.  The 
northern component (HCG 5A) was slightly brighter and larger.  HCG 5C is a difficult object 1' 
NW.

18" (11/23/05): N190 is a double system which often appears as an elongated glow, 40"x20", 
oriented N-S.  With careful viewing, the system just resolves into two very small round knots, 
just 20" between centers.  The northern component is ~20" diameter and the southern member 
~15". The two knots both have faint stellar nuclei and appear virtually tangent.  A third member, 
HCG 5C, is occasionally visible as an extremely faint knot off the NW side.

17.5" (12/11/99): Initially seen as a single faint, elongated glow at 220x.  At 280x in moments of 
good seeing this object cleanly resolved into two very close, very small knots with the brighter 
component on the north side.  HCG 5C was only intermittently visible with averted vision as a 
15" threshold knot.

17.5" (9/5/99): N190 is a challenging double system best viewed at high power.  Using 280x, at 
first appeared as an elongated irregular glow but with extended viewing, two "knots" oriented N-
S were resolved within a common halo.  The brighter and larger component (HCG 5A) is at the 
N end and appears very faint, very small, round, 20" diameter.  The southern component (HCG 
5B) is extremely faint and small, perhaps 15" diameter.  HCG 5C is a threshold knot 1' NW.  The 
HCG is a subgroup of AGC 76 whose core is ~20' SSE and includes IC 1565, 1566 and 1568.

17.5" (10/8/88): very close double system, faint, small, elongated SSW-NNE, irregular.  HCG 
5B is a very small companion attached at the S edge just 22" between centers.  In a compact 
group of four (HCG 5).

center.  Located 4.4' NW of mag 9.2 SAO 147389.  Forms a pair with N178 9' WNW.  Listed as 
nonexistent in the RNGC.  Member of the N210 group.

Lord Rosse discovered this object near N210 and described it in two observations made on 7 Dec 
1857 and 29 Oct 1877.  With respect to N210, he placed this discovery 25'± south and about 35s 
of RA west.  The description from 1877 reads "vF, S, lE pf, mbMN, stellar 5' nnf a coarse double 
star 10-11 and 12m."

The precise 1950 coordinates for N210 are 00 38 04.0 -14 08 54.  Using Rosse's offset from 
N210 places N207 at approximately 00 37.5 -14 34 (1950).  M-03-02-035 is located at 00 37 
09.8 -14 30 44 (1950) which is a close enough match given Rosse's rough offset.  Furthermore, 
this galaxy is also elongated E-W and is located 5' NNW (incorrectly given as NNE) of a wide 
double star at 40" separation matching the visual description from 1887.  So, the identification 
N207 = M-03-02-035 is virtually certain.  Reinmuth gives the same identification and notes that 
IC 41 is 4' N.  RNGC incorrectly identified N207 as nonexistent.  Discussed in RNGC

Discovered by Stephan (VIII).  His offset position is about 20" N of a mag 14.7 GSC star at 00 
40 59.5 +03 25 59 (2000).  Originally, Corwin identified N211 with this star.  Reinmuth writes 
"neb or *13.5, *11.8 n 2.7'."  This also refers to the same star.  In NGCBUGS, though, Corwin 
notes that Stephan misidentified his offset star (actually GSC 0014-1250 at 00 40 43.5 +03 28 
05) and when his offset are reapplied they point directly to N203, which was rediscovered later 
by Copeland.  So, in this case, Stephan deserves credit for this galaxy although it is identified as 
N203 in all modern catalogues.

V = 10.4;  Size 240"x210"

18" (10/13/07): visible unfiltered at 25x in the 80mm finder.  Nice contrast gain using the NPB 
filter and the planetary also appears to increase in size. 
In the 18" I had an excellent view at 175x using the NPB filter and the thin, bright irregular rim 
(only dimming on the east side) and darker center was quite striking.

33" (9/16/07): gorgeous annular planetary viewed at 200x.  The thin brighter rim was striking 
and varied in brightness and thickness around the periphery.  The rim is brightest along the 
western or WNW edge and weakest on the east side.  The interior was darker but irregular in 
surface brightness.

18" (8/23/03): I took a quick look at 160x from Chew's Ridge with a thin waning crescent low in 
the ENE.  Without a filter I don't remember the brighter rim being so crisply defined and the 
annularity so clear.  The superimposed stars gave the planetary a transparent, 3-dimensional feel 
as if I was looking into the object.  

17.5" (1/8/00): at 100x, appears as a moderately bright, 3.5' irregular glow with a darker center 
and encompassing four stars including the 12th magnitude central star.  Excellent contrast gain 
using an OIII filter, which sharpens up the edge of the roundish annulus and enhances the 
irregular surface brightness.  The halo is brightest along a 270° arc running from SW to NE and 
is clearly weakest at the E edge of the halo.  A mag 11.5 star is embedded at the NW edge of the 
halo 2.0' from center.  The irregular central hole is much darker but faintly luminous.  Also 
superimposed is a mag 12 star SW of the central star and a 4th star is just inside the eastern 
boundary.  The central star forms a thin right triangle with the other two brighter stars.  At 220x, 
the western 90° outer arc is brightest and there appears to be a knot embedded at the NE edge of 
the halo.

17.5" (9/19/87): fairly bright, large, 4' diameter, annular.  Four stars are involved including the 
central star.  This planetary has an irregular surface brightness with subtle structure. 

13" (11/05/83): fairly bright with filter, clearly annular, sharper edges.  NGC 255 lies 15' SSE. 

8": fairly faint, large, four stars involved.  No annularity noted.

16x80 (8/24/84): faintly visible in finder.

The sign of the declination is incorrectly listed as positive in the RNGC.  NGC position is

fainter detached portion of the southeast side.  The overall dimensions extend to 15'-18'.  The 
two lobes are fairly similar in size and surface brightness, though the following section is larger 
including the southern piece.  The western section has the brightest and most sharply defined 
edge running along its southern side and oriented E-W.  A long straight dust lane extends along 
the southern boundary of both lobes and defines the sharp edge on the western lobe.  The curving 
central dust lane oriented ~N-S intrudes into the nebula on the south side and nearly divides the 
two sections, though weaker nebulosity connects the two wings.

80mm: (2/16/07):  at 13x and a UHC filter, the PacMan nebula is easily visible surrounding the 
central star.

17.5" (9/28/02): the bright central quadruple (ADS 719 = Burnham 1) contains a bright mag 
8.6/9.1/9.8 trio at 4" and 9".  At 140x, a fainter companion (mag 10) at 1.54" separation is just 
visible close following the brightest member and is cleanly resolved at 324x.

17.5" (10/17/98): spectacular view of this detailed HII region at 100x using an OIII filter.  This 
15' nebulous complex has a mushroom appearance and is separated into three main lobes 
apparently by dust.  The brightest and largest lobe is following a bright triple star embedded near 
the center (8.6/9.2/9.8 at 4" and 9").  There appears to be a much fainter detached piece off the 
south end of this lobe.  Preceding the triple star is a section which is noticeably elongated and 
irregular in surface brightness fading to the NW.  The section to the north is faintest and 
separated from the eastern lobe by a curving dark lane.  A dark intrusion is visible south of the 
triple star which appears to be due to obscuring dust.

13" (8/24/84): very large, fascinating nebulosity, very irregular, dark gaps between sections, five 
brighter stars involved mag 8.6-12.5.  The brightest star is a very close double.

Discovered by E.E. Barnard on 26 November 1881 (Sidereal Messenger, Vol 2, p226 and AN 
108:369, 1884) and described as a large, faint nebula, very diffuse.  Incorrectly classified as an 
open cluster in the RNGC (Barnard made no reference to a cluster).  IC 1590 is a large, scattered 
cluster on the west side.  Barnard's IC 11 was placed 30 tmin W, but Corwin notes that his 
description "vF, L, triple * on np corner" points to N281 and there may have been a transcription 
error (see ICBUGS).

Marth's position for N297 was 2 tsec preceding and 1' S of N298.  Located 2' S of N298 is a 
close, faint double star which Marth may have mistook for a nebular image.  But 1.3' SW of 
N298 at 00 54 58.9 -07 20 59 (2000) is a nearly stellar galaxy which is a more likely candidate.

Marth's position matches M-01-03-043 = NPM1G -05.0031.  The galaxy identified as N321 in 
RNGC, MCG, and RC3 is a brighter galaxy M-01-03-041, located 5' further N.  This latter 
galaxy was viewed in my 13" and assumed to be N321.  It's odd that Marth did not also notice 
this galaxy.  This galaxy is identified as N325 in RNGC, MCG, PGC and DSFG.

Marth's position is a perfect match with M-01-03-045, which is an extremely faint edge-on in a

Leavenworth's position in list II is 00 58.8 -02 43 (2000).  The RNGC identifies N331 = M-01-

description.  Originally this object was not found by Corwin, but he now suggests a possible 
identification as N331 = M-01-03-012 at 00 47 06.9 -02 43 51, although this galaxy is 11.5 tmin 
W of Leavenworth's position.  This would require a 10 tmin error by Leavenworth (RA noted as 
doubtful) but this object does match in dec and there is a star 3' NE as in the notes (although 
closer to mag 14+). See NGCBUGS, Corwin.

Discovered by Leavenworth.  Although the RA from the first discovery paper in AJ, 7, 146 are 
generally very poor (given to the nearest minute and often incorrect by a few minutes of RA), 
Leavenworth also discovered N335 whose position is fairly accurate so can be used as a fixed 
reference.  Leavenworth placed N336 just 9' S of N335 but the galaxy chosen by the RNGC (M-
03-03-011) is located 30' S of N335.  According to Corwin who examined the original discovery 
sketch, N336 is a very faint peculiar galaxy or a colliding pair with three nearby stars whose 
relative position accurately matches the discovery sketch.  The ESO-Uppsala catalogue lists this 
galaxy as E541-IG 002 (not in MCG) at GSC position 00 58 02.8 -18 23 05.  This position is 
exactly 9' S of N335 matching Leavenworth's offset from N335.    E541-IG 002 is not in RC3 or 
MCG and is not identified as N336 in ESO.  ESO lists M-03-03-16= N366?, but this is a typo 
and ESO appears to be wrongly suggesting M-03-03-016 = N336.  See RNGC Corrections #5.

Discovered by Muller (II) and placed 1' N of N344. Listed as a possible star in Muller's

by RNGC (E475-006 is identified as N344 in ESO and RNGC). This star is mag 12, though, and 
Muller described N343 as mag 16 which does not match.  Corwin suggests N343/344 is the faint

N343, though there doesn't appear to be a faint star close by that I might have confused it with.

Discovered by Muller (II) along with N343.  Both objects described as possible stars.  Muller's 
rough position is 0.3 tmin E and 1.5' N of E475-006 (at GSC position 01 01 35.6 -23 15 54), 
which is identified as N343 in RNGC and with an uncertain NGC designation in ESO.  I missed 
it in my 17.5" at 280x on 10/4/97 and at 220x or 280x on 11/1/97.  The exact spot was examined 
using GSC chart close south of a mag 13 star. It seems very unlikely that Muller could have 
confused this star with a very faint galaxy.  As an alternative identification Corwin suggests that 
N343 and N344 may refer to a faint pair of galaxies (Arp-Madrone 0055-232) about 2.5 tmin W 
(matching in declination) of Muller's position.

distinct edge on the following side.  Extending from the central region, are two sweeping "arms" 
or extensions, creating an exaggerated "S" appearance similar to a barred spiral galaxy!  A longer 
but lower surface brightness arm is attached at the SE end of the central region and broadly 
sweeps towards the west, below the bar.  A shorter, but high surface brightness arm is attached at 
the NW end and hooks towards the east.  The extensions increase the diameter to 8'-10' in total 
size!  Without the filter, the nebula is set in a rich star field and a number of stars are 
superimposed or involved with the nebula, some in the center.  N371 is in same low power field

identify this galaxy as N347 and it was observed by Bigourdan: "I suspect an exceedingly faint 
object which could be nebulous, and which is situated toward 3°, d = 4', with respect to BD-
7°159."  Bigourdan also catalogued IC 67, IC 68, IC 71 and IC 72 in the immediate vicinity but

18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this bright globular is situated just north of the 
SMC (though much closer at ~20,000 ly) but unfortunately is overshadowed by 47 Tucanae on 
the west side of the SMC.  At 228x, it appeared very bright and well-resolved into a couple of 
hundred stars!  The rich halo is plastered with stars and extends to nearly 8'.  The 2' compressed 
core is well-concentrated to a blazing center (concentration class II).  Stars appear to stream out 
of the core in spiral curving lanes.  This globular has a classic symmetric appearance with a 
prominent, round core and halo.

18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x and UHC filter, this is a fairly bright, 
prominent, round SMC nebulous cluster, up to 6' in diameter with a fairly well-defined edge.  
The haze has a fairly consistent high surface brightness and seems suspended in a large, scattered 
cluster or star cloud.  A 5' string of four mag 10-11 stars oriented NW-SE are superimposed on 
the glow as well as a number of fainter stars.  This is an excellent low power field with the 
striking HII region N346 22' WSW and N395/IC 1624 8'-10' NE.

18" (11/18/06): faint triple star resolved at 280x.  The components form a very small equilateral 
triangle 1' N of a mag 12 star with the components ~10" apart.  The brightest component of the 
tirple is at the N vertex and the other two are mag 15-15.5.  NGC 370 may also refer to this 
multiple star.

Discovered by Dreyer in the N383 group.  The Birr Castle observation adds "the last nova [GC 
5146 = N372] looks at first sight like a hazy *, the higher power seems to resolve it, at all events 
sev luminous points were seen. Has a *12 in pos 166.5d, dist, 74"."  This pins down the 
equivalence with a triple star with a mean GSC position of 01 06 44.6 +32 25 43 (2000).  
D'Arrest's N370 probably also refers to this triple star.

with a nearly stellar nucleus.  This galaxy is identified as IC 89 in UGC, CGCG and RC3.  N446 
lies 19' WSW and N462 is 30' ESE.

Marth's position for N446 is 13 tsec E and 7' N of U00794 = M+01-04-006 which is an unusually 
large difference.  U00794 is identified as N446 in UGC, CGCG (411-010) and RNGC but not 
MCG. Corwin suggests a better candidate for N446 as U00818 = M+01-04-012 = CGCG 411-
016, which is a brighter galaxy located exactly 1.0 tmin E of Marth's position and which matches 
in declination.  This galaxy was later placed accurately by Javelle as IC 89 and is identified as IC 
89 in UGC, CGCG, MCG and RC3.  Reinmuth also makes the equivalence N446 = IC 89 and 
gives the IC position.  Although RNGC identifies N446 as U00794 it still equates IC 89 = N446 
(from Carlson via Reinmuth).

This field of galaxies involves several identification problems based on the NGC/IC entries for 
N443, 447, 449, 451, 453 and IC 1653, 1656, 1661.  The IC listings are likely duplicate entries 
as follows: N443 = IC 1653 (poor declination given by d'Arrest for N443), N447 = IC 1656 and 
N451 = IC 1661. Based on the NGC positions, the RNGC has reversed the identifications of 
N447 and N449 whose correct orientations should be SW-NE.  UGC and CGCG incorrectly 
identify N447 as N449 = IC 1656 and N449 is identied as IC 1661 in CGCG.  MCG identifies 
these galaxies correctly.  Discussed in RNGC Corrections #3 and NGCBUGS.

Discovered by Stephan (XII).  His RA is slightly off in the NGC but his original offset position 
is exact. This galaxy (M+05-04-009 = CGCG 502-018) is incorrectly identified as N447 in the 
RNGC which reverses the identifications of N447 and N449.  CGCG identifies this galaxy as IC

18" (7/6/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the second of three SMC clusters with

patches oriented NW-SE apparently separated by a dark lane with a total diameter of ~2.5'.  The 
NW component had a very small knot or star in the south end and the fainter SE section (= 
Henize N84B) has some stars involved.  Located 4' ESE of N456 with N465 a similar distance 
SE. A mag 10 star is close north.  The declination given in RNGC, DSFG, N2000.0 and U2000 
atlas is 1 degree too far N.

Discovered by JH (h2402) in the SMC and observed on 4 sweeps.  Described as the 2nd of three 
nebulous clusters with N456 (observed 3 times) and N465 (observed once). JH placed h2402 at a 
mean position of 01 14 40 -73 18.2 (2000) and this position was used in the GC and NGC.  
Nevertheless, the declination given in RNGC, DSFG, N2000.0 and U2000 is 1 degree too far N.  
The declination given in ESO is correct.  My listed position is near the mean of the two sections.

JH's declination for h2400 = N461 = E352-033 was 30' too far N but correct in RA.  He noted in 
his observation that because he was not able to relocate this galaxy he probably made an error in 
the declination. The RNGC position is 1.1 tmin too far W and 7' S (17' SW) of this galaxy and it 
is plotted incorrectly on the first edition of U2000.  MCG (-06-04-002) does not make the NGC

too far E.  Bigourdan's also rediscovered this galaxy (IC 97) and misidentified N475 with a star.  
N475 is not in MCG, CGCG or RC3.  GSC/NPM1G position 01 20 02.0 +14 51 40.

Discovered by Leavenworth (II). If there is a 40' error in the NGC declination, then N480 is 
identical to N481 (observed twice by Leavenworth).  It is also possibly the galaxy at GSC 
position 01 20 34.3 -09 52 50 (2000)  which I observed on October 4, 1997.  This galaxy satisfies 
the condition of being 40' S of N481 which is the relative offset in dec given by Leavenworth 
and this galaxy is tentatively identified as N480 in ESGC and NGCPOS.  N480 was not found by 
Bigourdan.  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.

17.5" (10/4/97): A stellar object was glimpsed a few times at my plotted position 5.5' N of N488 
on a GSC finder chart.  On DSS, the nearly stellar galaxy forms a close pair with a very faint star 
off the NE side.  It is possible that I glimpsed this star or the star + galaxy. This Rosse discovery 
is incorrectly identified as MCG +01-04-037 (close SW of N492) in RNGC.

Discovered by Rosse on 6 Dec 1850.  Observed on four occasions, although described as only 
suspected twice.  The position from 22 Oct 1876 placed N486 339" N (PA 353°) from N488.  
This corresponds with an extremely faint galaxy not in CGCG, MCG, RC3, PGC, NED or 
LEDA. The USNO-A1.0 position for this galaxy is 01 21 43.05 +05 20 46.6.  RNGC, PGC and

13.1" (8/8/86): fairly faint, small, elongated WSW-ENE, weak concentration.  Located at the NE 
end of a line of four mag 12-13 stars which extend to SW; the closest mag 13.5 star is 0.9' SW 
and is followed by a second parallel line of stars.  N512 lies 9' NW.  Incorrect RA by 0.6 minutes 
W in the RNGC and plotted incorrectly on the U2000.

Discovered by WH (III 169).  First in a group of 8 objects found on 13 September 1784 using 
Beta Andromedae as a reference star.  7 of the objects have varying errors in RA except N404.  
See NGCBUGS for the story.  The NGC position for N513 matches U00953 = M+06-04-016 = 
CGCG 521-020.  In this case, WH's RA would be off by ~30 tsec.  The RNGC RA is 0.6 tmin 
too small and plotted incorrectly on first version of U2000. The position is given correctly in 
UGC and RC3.

17.5" (12/9/01): although the identification is very uncertain (from Corwin), this number 
possibly applies to the mag 15 star just 30" preceding CGCG 502-084 = NGC 553?  The star was 
actually slightly easier to view than the galaxy.

Discovered by WH (III 172) along with N553 (III 173) during the problematic sweep of 13 
September 1784 which have several identifications questions. WH gave one (rough) position for 
both objects and described them as "Two. Both vS. stellar, a little doubtful." This object was not 
found twice by Bigourdan.  Dreyer notes the supposed observation at Birr Castle may refer to 
another object.  Reinmuth has "not found, = IC 110?; IC 110 = eF, vS, bM, IC 111 sf vnr."  
Corwin lists a possible identification of N552 with a star at 01 26 10.1 +33 24 21 just preceding 
CGCG 502-084.  In this case, WH's RA would be off by 1.5 tmin (the offsets are worse as the

Located at the eastern edge of the N507 group.  This identification is very uncertain due to a

Leavenworth's position for N563 in list I is 27' N of E542-013 = M-03-04-069 = NPM1G -

generally off in RA only.  This galaxy is identified as N563 in RNGC, SGC, RC3 and N546 
(uncertain) in ESO.  Instead, Corwin identifies N563 as a duplicate of N539 (also discovered by 
Leavenworth and given in list I) with a 2 tmin error in RA, which is typical.  Leavenworth's

17.5" (9/28/02): identified at 162x as a slightly fuzzy glow and cleanly resolved into a faint triple 
star at 325x (7.5mm Tak and Paracorr).  Situated ~30' SE of the core of M33.

17.5" (8/11/96): this is a faint, close triple star within M33 described as a "A S neb. or Cl. with 3 
st in it" by Lord Rosse.  It appeared as a faint nebulous spot at low power and was barely 
resolved at 220x.  The trio of mag 14/15 stars was cleanly resolved at 410x.  The maximum 
separation is 15", the close pair at 9" separation and the other side 12" with the trio forming a 3-
4-5 right triangle!  Located 28' SE of the center of M33.

This triple star superimposed on M33 was discovered by Lord Rosse on 29 Nov 1850 with a 
rough position but his description pins it down. "A S neb. or Cl. with 3 st in it.  It is about 8' ssp a 
[double star] whose components are of the 11 m.  RA 1h 26m +/- NPD 60d 35' +/-.  (I obs)."  
The components have a maximum separation of 15".  See NGCBUGS, Corwin.

The identification as a triple star was noted by Mayall and Aller (1942) in the article "The 
Rotation of the Spiral Nebula Messier 33," ApJ, 95, pp. 5-23.  Reinmuth also states "Cl of 3 st 
14" although noted as only an ef star (based on plates of M33) in the IC 2 notes.  Corwin gives a 
mean GSC position of 01 34 44.0 +30 13 58 (2000).  The RNGC New Description is "KN IN 
598 ZWICKY", but there is no nebulosity associated with the triple star.

Discovered by JH (h141).  Herschel has one observation with a rough position: "The RA 
conjectural and PD liable to some error."  Not found by d'A or Burnham (Publ of the Lick 
Observatory, Vol II) and listed as nonexistent in the IC 1 notes.  Burnham suggested this might 
be a duplicate observation of N614 in which case the object which precedes mentioned by JH 
would be N608 (misidentified as III 174).  Corwin also suggests that this number is a duplicate 
of N614 (See NGCBUGS for discussion).

17.5" (10/13/01): near Struve's position is a striking 1' chain of 5 stars mag 12.5-13.5 extended 
WSW-ENE.  Two of the stars at the following end of the chain form a very close pair.  There is 
also a wider trio of stars which follows by 6', but this is a courser, less interesting group in the 
field and less likely to fit Struve's description "3*+ neb".

Discovered by Struve.  GSC shows three mag 13/14 stars with the primary star at 01 40 12.5 +72 
51 52 and mininum separation 21".  There is also a tight string of 5 stars within 1.0' located 6' W

80mm (1/20/07): at 12.5x appears as a very faint, very small low surface brightness spot that 
blinks well using an OIII filter and increases significantly in contrast.  At 25x and OIII filter 
appears as a fairly faint, round knot with a fairly high surface brightness.

18" (10/19/06): superb view at 225x using a UHC filter.  The main bi-polar body was very 
bright, elongated ~SW-NE and dominated by two large, irregular knots at either end.  The SW 
knot is brighter and the brightest portion is more elongated in the direction of the minor axis.  
Both knots are somewhat irregular in shape and brightness.  A faint star is just off the SW end. 
The two bright knots are attached with a fainter bridge of nebulosity. Extending off the north end 
is a large "arm" that sweeps around towards the west and a slightly less obvious counterpart is 
attached at the south end and sweeps towards the east.  The overall effect mimics a photograph 
of a barred spiral galaxy or perhaps a rotating sprinkler head with jets of water curving away.

17.5" (8/2/86): bright, fairly large, consists of two prominent irregular lobes with a darker center; 
the SW lobe is brighter with straight edges while the NE lobe has a slightly curved edge.  A mag 
13.5 star is attached at the southern edge of the SW lobe.  Extending from the main body of this 
striking bipolar planetary is a large halo which contains two large outer arms or wings similar to 
a spiral galaxy!  The outer "arm" attached at the NE end is brighter and longer and curves to the 
west.  The southern extension is short, fainter and less defined.  The general features described 
above were clearly seen in the 13.1 at 166x using an OIII filter on 10/10/86.

13": SW end is brighter while the NE end is slightly curved.  Boxy appearance with a dark 
center.

Discovered by JH (h2446).  The position is 12 tsec W of a double star located 5.4' NE of N727 
(GSC has a single position at 01 54 11.3 -35 48 17) although h mentions the RA was only 
roughly taken by a star being out of the field.  The RNGC classification is a galaxy although the 
position and description "USB, CLOSE DB*?) applies to this double star.  N729 is identified as 
this close double by ESO.  But Corwin feels it is more likely that N729 is a duplicate observation 
of N727 which was discovered on an earlier sweep rather than a misidentification with a double 
star.  See NGCBUGS.

N757 = N731 using the relative separations.  See NGCBUGS.

NGC 0832
02 11 00.8 +35 32 29

17.5" (11/1/97): faint double star mag 14/15 at 7" separation.  Difficult to resolve cleanly at 220x 
in mediocre seeing due to faintness of NE compoent.  Easier to resolve at 280x.  Although the 
identification as N832 is not certain, this close double star could easily be mistaken as a small 
nebulous object.  Located 4.3' NE of a mag 9.5-10 star. Also 2' SW is a wider, brighter pair of 
mag 13.5-14 stars at 11" separation.

N832 is tentatively identified as a double star at 7" separation by Corwin (see NGCBUGS) with 
a mean GSC position of 02 11 00.8 +35 32 29.  This close double is 24 tsec following d'Arrest's 
position but fits his description of a mag 9-10 star 5' south-preceding (the actual separation is 
4.3').  RNGC identifies N832 with an extremely faint galaxy about 11' W of this double star (not 
in any other catalogue).  There is also a wider, brighter double at 11" separation nearby which 
could be a possible candidate although this double is only 2.3' from the mag 9.5 star.

Discovered by Swift (III).  Both Stephan (N846) and Swift (N847) described galaxies with 
nearly identical coordinates.  Stephan's micrometric position exactly matches the single galaxy in 
the vicinity but Swift's description and close position also pins down the same galaxy.  In 
Astronomische Nachrichten #2992, Spitaler concluded that N846 = N847 and CGCG and UGC 
concur.  Since Stephan first discovered this galaxy in 1877, his number N846 should apply by 
historical precedence. The RNGC incorrectly identifies N847 with an extremely compact galaxy 
(or very close double star) located 6' north of N846.  Listed in RNGC Corrections #2.

Discovered by WH (III 260).  The NGC position from JH matches U01727 = M+00-06-056 =  
Mrk 590 which is the brightest galaxy in the area. On 31 Oct 1886, Swift observed N856 (object 
22).  His description "eF, S, lE, F * close" matches the first galaxy in the group in description 
and position, which implies that N856 = N859.  See AN #2763.

Also on 31 Oct, Swift placed N885 (object 27) at 02 19 47 -00 46 13 (2000) with description 
"vF, vS, R, lbM."  This puts it 5 tmin of RA following N863 (similar dec) and suggests N885 = 
N863, assuming a large error in RA.  This implies that Swift reobserved the two brightest 
galaxies in the group on 31 Oct, namely N856 = N859 and N863 = N885 and additionally he 
observed this latter galaxy on 3 Oct as N866!

17.5" (10/25/97): this is the brighter and richer western member of the famous "double cluster". 
Includes a mag 6.6 star near the center and a mag 6.7 star 2.5' NNE.  Close following the mag 
6.6 star is a neat parabolic group of five stars opening towards the star.  On the W side of this 
star is a rich group of ~20 stars mostly arranged in an incomplete ring.  A faint curving string of 
stars from the mag 6.7 star leads to the parabolic quintet.  The 20' field at 220x has too many 
stars to count, but probably has ~200 stars.

8": this is the western component of the "double cluster".  Very bright, large, about 30' diameter.  
Very rich with about 100 stars resolved, includes several bright mag 6.5-7.0 stars in the center.  
Forms a pair with N884 at edge of 100x field.

the observation with certainty although the exact spot was examined using a GSC chart.  Located 
3' SSW of a mag 11 star. This galaxy is incorrectly listed as nonexistent in RNGC and is not 
plotted on U2000.

Discovery by Muller (list II) and placed at 02 13.8 -23 25 (1950).  He lists this object as mag 
15.5 (nucleus), 0.3'x0.1' in PA 170 deg and as possibly a double star.  Additionally, a mag 10 star 
is 2.8' in PA 320° (NW).  Burnham (Publ of Lick Observatory, II) could not find N874 "in or 
near this place." and Dreyer repeated this in IC I notes.

RNGC lists this object as nonexistent but it is identified in ESO and RC3 as E478-G18 = M-04-
06-019 at 02 16 02.0 -23 18 22 (J2000), which is just 7' S of Muller's position.  Furthermore, 
Muller's PA closely matches the 173 deg listed in the ESO and there is a mag 11 star at 
separation 2.9', although it is NE instead of NW.  This galaxy is identified as N874 in RC3.  
MCG (M-04-06-019) does not make the NGC equivalence and ESO lists the NGC number as 
uncertain.

18" (10/13/07): NGC 896 and IC 1795 form a bright, detailed HII region at the NW corner of the 
huge IC 1805 HII ring ("Heart Nebula").  This complex is split into three or 4 distinct sections by 
dust lanes.  The largest section is IC 1795, which extends mostly north of a mag 10 star for ~8'.  
To the west of the mag 10 star is a  dust lane oriented NW-SE and beyond this lane to the west is 
a small, moderatly high surface brightness patch (NGC 896) of 2' diameter.  To the east of the 
star is another broad dust lane extending N-S and following this lane is a fainter wash of 
nebulosity that streams to the north for over 15' in length.  It passes through mag 9 SAO 12287 
and just north of this star the nebulosity has a small, brighter patch.  Initially, I thought the 
complex ended here on the NE side, but then additional fainter nebulosity was noticed spreading 
out to the west for several arc minutes increasing the total size to 15'-20' for both N-S and E-W 
directions.  

17.5" (11/27/92): at 100x with OIII filter this is a fairly bright emission nebula, very large,  about

~7' diameter and a star is off the NW edge.  A weak dark lane separates N896 from faint IC 
1795.  The region is weakly nebulous without filter.

Trianguli.  Several mag 13/14 stars in a curving chain are just south.  This galaxy is identified as 
UGC 1890 in most sources.  See Corwin's comments.

17.5" (8/5/97): fairly faint, moderately large, elongated SW-NE, 1.5'x0.8', broad concentration 
with large slightly brighter core.  Located close north of a semi-circular group of stars and just 
2.0' NNW of mag 8.2 SAO 55553.  The identification of this galaxy with NGC 917 is uncertain 
and this number is listed as nonexistent in RNGC.

Discovered by JH (h220) and described as "vF, S, R, forms a semicircle with 4 st." The 5 Nov 
1874 Birr Castle observation states "no nebulosity seen, only 3 st about 18-20 mag close together 
nearly in a line pf." In the NGC notes, Dreyer adds: "h220.  No neb, only a vs, Cl with 4 st nr np 
(2 Birr obs, 1874-76, not found by d'Arrest)."  Reinmuth found this object "v doubtful? Neb* 
14.7 nr Dreyer's place."  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.

DSS shows two very close pairs of extremely faint stars oriented east-west at h's original position 
(as mentioned in the Rosse observation) but Corwin identifies N917 = U01890 at GSC position 
02 26 07.7 +31 54 44 which is exactly 20' S of h's place.  This galaxy also matches his 
description of 4 nearby stars! Thomson notes it is very odd that assuming N917 = U01890 that 
Herschel did not mention the nearby mag 8 star but instead mentioned the four nearby faint stars.

Discovered by Stone (II).  A mag 10 star was described by Stone as attached and there is a 
similar star very close to his position so N961 may just be this star.  But HC identifies N961 as a 
duplicate of N1051.  This would imply a 10 tmin error in RA (digit error) but the declinations are 
similar and Stone's description applies to N1051 - there is a mag 12 star (his magnitudes are 
generally too bright by 1-2 mag's) close and the PA of the galaxy matches.  Listed as nonexistent 
in RNGC.

Discovered by Stephan (III).  There was a problem with his position as his 6th magnitude 
reference star (15 Triangulum) is not at his place.  The error was caught and there is a footnote in 
MN XXXII which states the reference star is in error (although there was a typo in the corrected 
position).  Because this note was later missed, Reinmuth and Carlson could not find N983 and it 
is listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.  Corwin has identified N983 = N1002.  Using Stephan's 
offsets (3 tmin 8 tsec and 3' 38") from 15 Tri matches N983 with the position of N1002!  See

RNGC, CGCG, and UGC (notes) misidentify N998 as CGCG 414-028 which is located 3.2' N.

Marth discovered N997 and N998 in October of 1863 and placed N998 2s of RA following N997 
and 1' N.  His precessed positions for 2000 are:

Marth 64    02 37 15  +07 19  "F, S"  = N997
Marth 65    02 37 17  +07 20  "vF     = N998

There are three galaxies in the vicinity with the following GSC positions:

U02102          02 37 14.5 +07 18 23  = M+01-07-016 = CGCG 414-27
M+01-17-015     02 37 16.5 +07 20 09
CGCG 414-028        02 37 20.3 +07 26 23
 
So, the following identifications appear secure based on Marth's position:

N997 = U02102 = M+01-07-016 = CGCG 414-27
N998 = M+01-017-015

The third object, CGCG 414-028, is a small, faint galaxy situated 1.8' NNE of N997 which I 
observed with my 17.5" and certainly would have been picked up by Marth using Lassell's 48".

Here is where things get interesting regarding N998:  CGCG, UGC (notes) and RNGC all 
misidentify CGCG 414-028 as N998.  UGC lists the correct N998 in the notes for N997 although 
as an anonymous companion.  PGC has the correct galaxy but incorrectly equates M+01-07-015 
= CGCG 414-028.  These errors probably originated in CGCG.  Two sources appear to have the 
correct object: MCG identifies M+01-017-015 = N998 as well as Reinmuth (Die Herschel-
Nebel, 1926).  MCG incorrectly places N998 3s of RA west of N997 but N998 follows N997 by 
2s of RA (if MCG messed up the dec instead then their identifications are reversed).  Listed in 
RNGC Corrections #7.

Stephan's position (XII) for N1072 matches UGC 2208 = MCG +00-07-088. There is obviously 
a typo in the coordinates of N1072 in the RNGC as the RA is given as 00 01.3.  If Javelle 
reversed the sign of his declination offset from his reference star, then J.945 = IC 1837 would be 
an exact match with N1072.  Although this seems a reasonable assumption (it occured in several

is very uncertain due to poor positions in the group by Marth and UGC, MCG and CGCG 
identify this galaxy as IC 1846.

Discovered by Marth in a group of galaxies with several problem identifications (bad positions 
or faint stars?).  RNGC and RC3 identify N1109 as U02293 = M+02-08-011.  This galaxy was 
later correctly placed by Javelle as IC 1852 and CGCG, UGC and MCG use the IC designation.  
Marth's position for N1109 is 39 tsec E and 2' N of U02293.

Corwin suggests that N1109 may instead refer to IC 1846 = U02265 = M+02-08-006 = CGCG 
440-008 (also from Javelle), which is located 2.0 tmin W of Marth's position but an exact match

from Javelle), located at 02 48 39.1 +13 15 34 (not in GSC).  If this uncertain ID is correct, then 
Marth's RA is 1.0 tmin off (too far E), although the galaxy is a fairly good match in dec. The 
galaxy identified as N1111 in RNGC is located 7' S and 9' E of U02293 = N1112 (identification 
suggested by Corwin).  Neither NED nor PGC has a listing for IC 1850. See RNGC Corrections 
#2 and notes for N1109.

V = 13.8;  Size 1.2x0.9;  Surf Br = 13.8;  PA = 3d

17.5" (1/9/99): very faint, fairly small, ~40"x25".  Appears as a very low surface brightness glow 
with no noticeable concentration and an ill-defined edge.  After extended viewing could hold 
continuously with direct vision.  IC 1850 = N1111: lies 5.6' NW and IC 1846 = N1109: is 19' W.  
The NGC identification is very uncertain due to a poor position from Marth. This galaxy is 
identified as IC 1852 in CGCG, UGC and MCG and identified as N1109 in RNGC and RC3.

Discovered by Marth in a group including N1109, N1111, N1113, N1115, N1116 and N1117 
and N1127.  Several of these galaxies are nonexistent or have poor positions including N1109, 
N1111, N1112, N1113 and N1117 and this number is listed as nonexistent in RNGC.

Corwin suggests that N1112 may refer to U02293 = M+02-08-011 = Z440-015 = IC 1852 
(correct position by Javelle) with a 1 tmin error by Marth in RA (too far E) but a good match in 
dec.  This galaxy is identified as IC 1852 in CGCG (440-015), UGC (U02293) and MCG 
(M+02-08-011), listed as N1109 in RNGC and RC3 and N1109 = IC 1852 in PGC! GSC

Marth placed N1117 at 02 50 43 +13 10 (2000).  RNGC identifies N1117 as the double galaxy 
(U02337s = M+02-08-019/020 = Z440-022s).  This galaxy is located at a mean GSC position of 
02 51 13.0 +13 11 20 (2000) but is not identified as N1117 in CGCG or MCG.  N1117 was 
discovered on the same night as N1109, N1111, N1112 and N1113 which all have very uncertain 
identifications (as well as N1115, N1116).  In this case, the error would be 30s in RA.  Discussed

18" (11/22/08): on initial glance the brightest galaxy in AGC 400 appeared faint, small, 
elongated 3:2 N-S, 25"x18". I soon realized this was an extremely close contact pair oriented N-
S with two tangent knots (described in the professional literature as a "dumb-bell system") just 
16" between centers in a very small common halo.  Each component is no more than 15" in 
diameter with the southern member brighter.

17.5" (11/28/97): very faint, small, elongated 2:1 N-S, 40"x20", irregular surface brightness.  On 
careful examination the glow resolved into a very close pair of extremely small galaxies oriented 
N-S with tangent halos [just 16" between centers!].  This double system is the brightest in AGC 
400 with CGCG 415-040 3.5' SW.

The identification of this galaxy with NGC 1128 is very uncertain as Swift's position is 5 tmin 
preceding.

Discovered by Swift (V).  A mag 14.8 star at 02 52 37.9 +06 02 24 (J2000) is very close to 
Swift's position of 02 52 36 +06 02 41.  His description mentions "2 pF st. close p" and since 
there is a pair of mag 13.4/13.9 stars at 28" separation about 4.5' W, I initially identified N1128 
with this mag 14.8 star.

But Corwin gives a possible identification of N1128 = CGCG 415-041 = MCG +01-08-027, 
which is the brightest galaxy (double) in AGC 400.  If this identification is correct, Swift made a 
5 tmin error in RA.  There are a couple of mag 12-13 stars just west of this double system which 
might be Swift's "2 pf st. close p".

This "dumbbell" galaxy is associated with the radio source 3C 75 and each component exhibits a 
twin radio jet.

N1188 is the first of a group of five galaxies recorded by Leavenworth in list I including N1189, 
N1190, N1191 and N1192.  Although Leavenworth only gave a single rough RA for these 
objects (corrected by 3 min of RA in a note in the second discovery list), Howe provided precise 
individual RA's which were listed in the notes and corrections section of the IC2.

Howe's position for N1188 is 03 01 23 -15 41 46 (1950) and very close to these coordinates is 
M-03-08-068 with a GSC position of 03 01 23.0 -15 40 46 (1950).  It is interesting to note that 
this places N1188 just 8' N of N1199 which is the brightest member of the compact group

The RNGC incorrectly lists N1188 as nonexistent and Sulentic identifies it as equivalent to

24" (4/4/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this was the first object I decided to take a look 
at in the 24" f/3.7 as it was probably the brightest remaining galaxy that I had not observed.  I 
was amazed to find a striking, two-armed barred spiral with obvious bright HII knots in the 
arms!  At 200x the main body of the galaxy appeared as a bright oval or wide bar ~4.5'x3.5' 
oriented SSW-NNE with a central bulge.  Emerging from the SSW end is a relatively short arm 
that hooks towards the NW.  Embedded with this extension is a brighter elongated HII knot, 
~30"x20".  A mag 15 star is west of the NW end of this arm.  Just east of the NNE end of the 
main bar is a brighter HII knot, ~30"x15", oriented E-W.  A faint star (or stellar knot) is less than 
1' NW.  This bright HII region is embedded in a diffuse arm that curves gently ESE from the N 
end of the bar.  After the bright knot, this extension dims but ends at a third bright knot, ~15" 
diameter, that is isolated the end of this arm (nearly due E of of the core).  This object is on a 
small list of Starburst galaxies with young globular-cluster-like clusters (SSC's).

Discovered by WH (III 959) with a poor position.  The correct position was later given by 
Bigourdan (IC 324).  In Scientific Papers of WH Dreyer notes for N1331: "This is IC 324, 11 
seconds following, 1.2' S of N1332.  NGC 1331 is to be struck out."  WH's description stated 
"The 2nd of 2, vF, vS, 1.5' SE N1332.", so his discovery is secure.  The RNGC incorrectly 
equates N1331 =  E548-016 located 3.4' W of N1332.

18" (1/20/07): fairly large, striking reflection nebula with a 10th magnitude star at the NE end.  
The nebula curves to the southwest ending with a 1' brighter knot with very faint star involved 
near its edge.  A couple of mag 14 stars are superimposed between the mag 10 star and the knot.  
The total size is roughly 7'x4'.  The surrounding region (particularly to the north) is nearly 
starless and clearly affected by dust.  This region has a number of Herbig-Haro objects and is an 
active star formation region.

17.5" (2/9/02): bright, interesting reflection nebula at 140x.  Apparently illuminated by a mag 10 
star oddly offset at the NE end of the glow.  The appearance is irregular; extending ~10'x6' SW-
NE in the general direction of a mag 10 star 11' SW.  The SW extension contains a couple of 
faint mag 14 stars and ends at a small, brighter knot which appears to surround a very faint star 
or stars.  The field is oddly void of faint stars and there is a large starless region to the north (this 
is the dark nebula Barnard 2).

17.5" (12/8/90): fairly bright reflection nebula surrounds a mag 10 star which is offset to the NE 
side of the nebula.  This is a large object, about 10'x6' and elongated SW-NE.  There is a bright 
knot in the SW end.  Two or three 15th magnitude stars are superimposed.

18" (1/17/09): superb view at 115x and OIII filter.  Appears as a huge oval, elongated 3:2 SSW-
NNE and extends ~6'x4 and surrounds a mag 10.5 central star.  This showpiece planetary is 
clearly asymmetric and notably brighter on the NNE side in a sector extending from the center 
and fanning out to the north.  This brighter region is irregular in surface brightness and slightly 
dims before brightening along the NNE rim.  The south side is slightly fainter and contains a 
weaker arc or lane.

18" (1/1/08): faintly visible in the 80mm finder at 25x as a dim oval glow surrounding a faint 
star.  Adding a OIII filter significantly incrased the contrast and the outline appeared better 
defined.  At 115x in the 18", this unusual planetary is a huge oval or irregular egg-shape, ~6'x4', 
oriented SSW-NNE (PA ~30°) surrounding a very bright mag 10.4 central star.  Excellent 
contrast with an OIII filter which really brings out its asymmetric structure.  The planetary is 
noticeably brighter in a fan-shaped wedge spreading out from the central star to the north.  At 
times the NE rim appeared a bit clumpy.  The fainter south side has a slightly darker lane 
extending to the southeast.

17.5" (11/17/01): At 100x with OIII filter, this huge planetary appears a very large oval 3:2 or 
4:3 SSW-NNE, ~6'x4.5' with a striking central star.  Appears clearly brighter on the north side of 
the central star in a section defined by a triangular wedge with apex at the central star.  The 
nebulosity dims a bit on the west side as well as the south.

17.5" (10/8/88): very bright, elongated 3:2 SSW-NNE, 6'x4' diameter, very bright central star

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the best visual barred spiral in the sky and 
although it was only at 33° elevation (well past the meridian), the view was stunning at 200x 
with its long sweeping arms making a slashing cosmic "Z" in the eyepiece.  I was also surprised 
by the structure in the fairly small, extremely bright core that is embedded in the 3' E-W bar.  On 
the north edge of the mottled core, a very short, hooking appendage extended towards the NE 
with a fainter counterpart on the SW end.  This gave the small core the appearance of a tiny 
barred spiral!  At the west end of the bar a bright arm emerges, dramatically sweeping back to 
the NNE (sharp 110° angle) beyond a mag 12.5 star that is situated near the 1/3 mark of its total 
length.  The counterpart on the east end of the bar shoots to the SW, reaching a faint star at its 
end.  The total distance between the tips of the arms is roughly 10'.

18" (12/30/08): although a pale imitation of the view from Australia, with careful viewing at 
175x the spiral arm attached at the west end of the central bar was faintly visible sweeping to the 
NNE for ~3' in length.  The counterpart on the SE side was not seen.

20" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): At 127x and 212x, N1365 appeared as an 
amazing two-armed barred spiral, similar to the photographic appearance.  The core is a quite 
bright, bulging oval embedded in a larger bar oriented ~E-W.  Attached at opposite ends of the 
bar are two long, graceful arms which extend quite a distance and are nearly straight.  The arm 
attached on the west side of the bar wraps around a mag 12.5 star about 1' NW of the core and 
extends well beyond towards the NNE.  The opposite arm attached on the following end is 
slightly fainter and shoots towards the SSW.  The tips of the outer arms dramatically increase the 
total size of the galaxy.

glimpse though the observation may have been affected by clouds or contrails.  Located 4.7' W 
of N1399 in the Fornax I cluster.

Due to a poor position by Julius Schmidt (14' due south) with a 6" refractor, this identification is 
uncertain.

Schmidt's position is 03h 36.1m -35° 50' (1950).  There is no galaxy here and the RNGC 
classifies NGC 1396 as nonexistent.  The SGC and RC3, though, identify a galaxy in the heart of 
the Fornax cluster at 03 36 11.2 -35 36 10 (1950).  This position is 14' due N of Schmidt's 
location and places NGC 1396 just 5' WNW of the bright elliptical NGC 1399.  Listed as 
nonexistent in the RNGC.  Based on my visual observation, though, I'm not convinced that 
Schmidt could have picked up this galaxy with a 6" refractor.

Given the size of Schmidt's telescope (6.2" refractor) and other problems with his table, HC feels 
this object is a reasonable match and the only faint galaxy in the immediate vicinity.  Additional 
data includes a 1975 position of 03h 37.1m -35d 31', dimensions 1.0'x0.9' and total blue 
magnitude of 14.8.  This galaxy is in RC3 and SGC but not in ESO.  Discussed in RNGC

SE of N1398 in northeast Fornax.  Classified as nonexistent in the RNGC due to a poor 
declination by John Herschel.

Found by John Herschel on 20 November 1835 and placed at 03 40 31.2 -26 12 51 (2000).  The 
RNGC lists this object as nonexistent since no galaxy was found at h's position.  ESO-LV and 
RC3 identify NGC 1412 = E482-029 = M-05-09-021 at 03 40 29 -26 51.7 (2000), or 40' due S of 
h's position.

This galaxy is a good match with h's description- "F, S, E, gpmbM, 15", has a * south following 
distance 2 arcmin" as the galaxy is elongated NW-SE and there is a mag 12 star 1.6' SSE.  The 
poor declination probably resulted from an erroneous digit.  Swift later observed this galaxy and 
it was recatalogued as IC 1981, this time with the correct position and ESO and MCG identifies 
the galaxy as IC 1981. Listed in RNGC Corrections #6 and NGCBUGS.

Discovered by Muller (II). Howe's corrected position is a perfect match with E482-034 = M-04-

17.5" (3/2/02): at 100x, the Merope Nebula is the brightest of the reflection nebulae that encase 
the Pleiades.  It appears as a moderately bright, very large, fan-shaped cone of light extended in a 
wedge SW to SE from  Merope.  The boundary of the nebulosity is straighter and better defined 
along the SE edge where it follows a string of mag 10-11 stars.  The SW border is not as well 
defined but extends beyond a trio of mag 13 stars.  The fan is broadest at its southern extremity 
which is roughly 15' from Merope.

16x80 (12/22/84): the Merope nebula was faint but definite in the 16x80 finder using a Deep Sky

Discovered by Dunlop (562).  Reobserved by John Herschel as h2581 = N1436 (h gave the 
rough place from Dunlop as he did not measure the position).  Described as "evidently a globular

JH's descriptions of h2585 = NGC 1448 and h2586 = NGC 1457 (observed on different nights) 
clearly apply to the same object.  N1454 was observed three times and N1448 only once on 
sweep 654.  But h's RA for N1448 is 50s too far W (dec is exact).  So, it seems more appropriate 
to designate this galaxy as N1457 whose position was given correctly on three observations and 
furthermore was discovered on an earlier sweep!  Identified as N1448 = N1457 in ESO and 
N1448 in MCG.  The center is not in GSC although there are numerous entries along the arms.

Leavenworth's position for #386 in list II is 03 43.8 -18 48 (1950).  His position angle (lE in 30 
deg) matches the bar of N1452, so this identification is reasonable.  In N2000 and SGC, N1455 
is listed as identical to N1452 (and ESO with ?). 

RNGC matches N1455 with a galaxy located 0.8 tmin E of N1452 at 03 43.9 -18 47 (1950) 
which is a good match with Leavenworth's position and ESO lists E549-014 at 03 43 37 -18 50.1

This galaxy is identified as IC 2002 in UGC, MCG, CGCG and RC3 due to a poor declination by 
Marth. RNGC reverses the sign of the declination.

Marth's position for N1474 is 8' S of U02898 = M+02-10-003 = CGCG 442-005 while Javelle's 
position for IC 2002 is a perfect match with this galaxy. Several objects discovered by Marth that 
evening have poor positions including N1141 and N1142 (dec error of 40').  This galaxy is 
identified as IC 2002 in UGC, MCG, CGCG, RC3.  In addition, the RNGC has also reversed the 
sign of the declination (repeated in N2000).  Assuming an 8' error, the NGC ID is correct.  
Corwin concurs that N1474 = IC 2002.  The RNGC declination for 1975 should be changed to 
+10d 29'.  Not plotted on U2000.  Listed in RNGC Corrections #6 and NGCBUGS.

18" (1/20/07): at 115x and 174x and OIII filter appears as a bright, large, elongated HII region on 
the west side of an 11th magnitude star.  Appears roughly 4'x2', extending SSW to NNE and 
brighter on the south end.  The west side has a fairly hard, well-defined edge while the east side 
is more irregular and fades into the background.  Four faint stars are involved on the northern 
end and a pair of fainter stars are at the south end.

17.5" (3/2/02): at 100x, this is a moderately bright, roundish glow, ~3' diameter.  Extends mostly 
west of a mag 11 star, wrapping around the star, particularly on the north side.  Excellent contrast 
gain with an OIII filter as it appears bright with an irregular surface brightness.  There is a subtle 
bite cut out of the nebulosity on the east side that creates a darker hollow extending just west of 
the star.  At 220x (unfiltered), about a half dozen stars are involved or at the edges.  The 
nebulosity is quite irregular with a high surface brightness region preceding the star.  Faint, 
elongated haze extends from this patch to the NE past the star giving an elongated appearance. 
 A pair of mag 13-14 stars is at the northern end and another pair is just off the western edge.

13x80mm (1/13/07): excellent view in my 80mm finder using a 24mm Panoptic and an H-beta 
filter as a huge, elongated bar of fairly high contrast stretching across the field.  The glow is 
generally brightest in the broad middle section between Xi Persei and the 6th magnitude star off 
the central north side.  The nebula noticeably tapers towards the southeast end as the northern 
side of this end squeezes inward.  Similarly, the northwest end also tapers as the northern 
boundary narrows towards the southern side.

17.5" (1/16/02): Despite its reputation as a challenging target, this was an easy, fascinating object 
at 64x with a H-beta filter. The California Nebula is HUGE and extended a full two eyepiece 
fields even using a 31 Nagler for a total length of over 2.5 degrees and with a varying width of 
15'-30', extended WNW-ESE.  The E-W border is well-defined with a filter, particularly in the 
general vicinity of Xi Persei (middle of three naked-eye stars in the leg of Perseus collinear with 
the Pleiades) on the southern border and a long straight stretch on the northern edge.  Along the 
northern edge, there is some filamentary, wispy structure similar to the view of the Veil nebula in 
a small scope!

The nebulosity is weaker and more disorganized, though, close to the preceding and following 
ends. The nebula tapers towards the eastern end where there are some additional brighter streaks 
and dark intrusions near a group of stars.  Portions of the central region are clearly fainter with 
no evident structure.  At the west end the structure is also chaotic with an irregular mix of weak 
nebulosity and darker voids.  There is much to view here even at 64x, and I spent 30 minutes 
scanning the entire length for structure. 

17.5" (10/28/89): the California Nebula requires very low power and visibility is best using an 
H-beta filter.  At 82x appears very large, faint, very elongated, irregular low surface brightness 
with darker lanes and some wispy structure along the edges.  The most well-defined section of 
the border is near a mag 8.5 star bordering the southern edge.  Located roughly 30' N of mag 4.0 
Xi Persei.

13.1" (1/18/85): definite contrast gain with H-beta filter as only the section NW of Xi was 
definite using a Daystar 300 filter (siimlar to UHC), but the H-beta shows the full extent easily.

16x80 (7/27/84): very large and faint, very elongated WNW-ESE, sharper and brighter on WNW 
edge, very low surface brightness.  Improved contrast with an H-beta filter.

steadily visible.  On closer inspection the thin rim was clearly irregular in surface brightness and 
slightly brighter along the SW and NE sides with a couple of tiny knots embedded in the rim.  
The slightly darker interior was weakly mottled or patchy with subtle variations in surface 
brightness.

17.5" (1/8/00): at 100x, this moderately bright PN was irregularly round, 1' diameter, weakly 
annular with a faint glimpse of the central star.  There was a good contrast gain with the OIII 
filter and the image was crisp-edged, slightly elongated SW-NE and the small, darker center was 
more evident.  Excellent view at 220x with the faint central star (mag 14.4) clearly visible.  The 
surface brightness was irregular with an unevenly brighter outer rim.  The central star was visible 
steadily at 280x and the overall surface brightness was mottled or "clumpy" (brighter on W and 
NE rim), darkening in the center.

17.5" (2/11/96): at first view (fairly poor seeing) appeared as a single but irregular galaxy 
elongated 2:1 NNW-SSE, 1.0'x0.5'.  In periods of better seeing, the system resolved into an 
extremely close contact pair with the brighter component at the SSE end, round, 25" diameter.

This double system was discovered by WH (III 499) and observed twice by JH at the Cape 
although not resolved. Harold Corwin equates Stone's N1524/N1525 with N1516 A/B.  Since 
N1516 was discovered first by William Herschel, it seems more appropriate that his number 
should apply to this gx, although it was only given a single designation.  The RNGC dec is 3' too

18" (1/1/08): In good seeing at 565x the complex double shell structure of this gorgeous 
planetary was remarkable.  The bright mag 12.5 central star is surrounded by a well-defined dark 
central hole with subtle mottling.  This is surrounded by a striking bright inner ring that is 
relatively narrow and sharply defined. The ring has a clumpy appearance, particuarly on the 
north side and it dims slightly on the SE end.  This 20" diameter ring is encased within an outer 
shell of fainter nebulosity that doubles the diameter.  Although the inner ring is round, this outer 
envelope is slightly elongated SSW-NNE.  At 807x the view was stunning with brighter knots 
within the inner ring appearing to sparkle at times.

13x80mm (1/15/07): fairly bright stellar object at 13x in my 80mm finder and very easy to

with a fairly sharp edge embedded in a fainter roundish halo roughly doubling the diameter.  The 
inner shell was irregularly darker surrounding the central star.

17.5" (2/8/91): very bright, fairly small, high surface brightness, mag 12.5 central star visible,

has a small dark annulus surrounding the central star and the outer envelope is fainter and more 
diffuse.

17.5" (11/10/96): at the position of Struve's Lost Nebula is a mag 14 star noted in the observation 
of N1555 (Hind's Variable Nebula).  This star is 4' WSW of T Tauri and is not involved with 
nebulosity.

Struve's Lost Nebula is part of the T Tauri nebulosity with N1555 (Hind's Variable Nebula).  
Discovered by O. Struve in 1868 and also observed by d'Arrest.  Described in the Notes section 
of NGC by Dreyer as "neb, S, with an eccentric nucleus = *14".  He notes that he was unable to 
perceive any nebulosity near the place with Lord Rosse's 6-foot telescope in 1877 and not found 
by Tempel.  In the IC 2 notes and corrections section, Dreyer comments that Struve's nebula was 
not found by Barnard in 1895 or by Keeler on plates taken in 1899.

Modern sources such as Sky Catalogue 2000.0 group N1554 and N1555 together as a single 
object, although Corwin notes that NGC 1554 is not visible on the Palomar Sky Survey plates.  
At the NGC position and Bigourdan's position, there is a mag 14 star.  RNGC incorrectly groups 
N1554/1555 together and places them about 1 tmin too far E.  See NGCBUGS for more of the 
story.

Size 1

17.5" (11/10/96): this refers to Hind's variable nebula, illuminated by T Tauri (9-13).  At 100x 
and 140x (unfiltered) an extremely faint haze was highly suspected on the W or WSW side of T 
Tauri (mag 9) in the direction of a mag 14 star to the west or slightly south (this star is Struve's 
N1554).  No details were visible at 100x (did not appear as an arc) but a sketch made at 100x 
exactly matched the orientation of the nebulosity with respect to T Tauri.  Nebulosity was not 
visible at 220x and no nebulosity was noted following T Tauri.

This is the famous Hind's Variable Nebula surrounding the variable T Tauri, discovered by Hind 
on Oct. 11, 1852 with a 7-inch refractor.  It appears that it was rediscovered by Breen in 1855. 
The NGC position is correct.  See comments by Dreyer in NGC, IC I and IC II notes section for 
discussion of various observations.  Also see observations by Burnham in Publ. of Lick 
Observatory, II.  Modern sources often group N1554 and N1555 (discovered by Struve) together, 
although there is no nebulosity visible on the Sky Survey surrounding the star at Struve's 
position.

The RNGC RA for N1554 (and N1555) in 1.0 tmin too far E.  The position of the nebula was 
verified on the POSS (extremely faint on blue POSS but prominent on the red print) and listed in 
RNGC Corrections #6.  The position stated in the Sky Catalogue 2000 of 04 21.8 +19 32 
corresponds with the variable T Tauri (04 21 59.4 +19 32 08, GSC) which illuminates the 
nebula.  The RNGC position should be corrected to 04 20.4 +19 29 (1975).  See NGCBUGS for 
further discussion.

18" (1/17/09): at 380x this unusual starburst galaxy appeared as a high surface brighness streak, 
elongated ~5:2 WNW-ESE.  The brightest region is NW of center and contains two stellar or 
quasi-stellar knoits (super-star clusters) within the glow.  One of these "stars" is fairly easy and 
the other is occasionally visible.  A very faint stellar object is closer to the geometric center.  The 
ESE side of the galaxy is fairly uniform though the position angle is slightly offset.  The galaxy 
lies close S of a mag 9.8 star.

17.5" (3/1/03): at 380x this is a bright, very elongated galaxy with an unusual asymmetric 
appearance, situated less than 1' S of a mag 9.5 star!  Extended nearly 5:2 NW-SE, 2.0'x0.8'.  The 
bright core is offset to the NW side of the glow with a tail extending SE, possibly bending at a 
slight angle to the core.  Two stellar "nuclei" are visible in good seeing.  The brighter "star" is 
embedded with the core, possibly just slightly N of center.  A second fainter "star" is close SE, 
near the edge of the core and is visible intermittently.  These "stars" are actually SSC's (luminous 
super-star clusters).  N1569 was recently determined to be a member of the IC 342 galaxy group.

17.5" (1/12/02): very bright, elongated 5:2 WNW-ESE, 2.5'x1.1', high but irregular surface 
brightness with an asymmetric appearance.  The very bright core is mottled and irregular and is 
offset to the NW side of the galaxy!  At 380x, there are two stellar "nuclei" within this glow.  
The brighter stellar nucleus is fairly easy and a fainter stellar point is close SE.  There is also a 
strong impression of a third stellar spot close W of the central nucleus.  These faint "stars" are 
actually luminous super-star clusters, the most massive known type of star clusters (color image 
at http://www.lowell.edu/users/dah/papers/n1569hst.html).  A mag 10 star is close off the N side,

18" (11/26/03): at 115x, appears a very large, scattered field with a number of brighter stars.  
There are no denser regions of fainter stars to distinguish this as a cluster although the star 
density drops rapidly to the west (edge of Milky Way?).  Most distinctive is a stream of bright 
stars which extends 20' SW of the cluster's position and includes a number of mag 8-10 stars.  
The string begins with mag 8.7 SAO 39581 and includes a 16" pair of mag 10 stars as well as 
mag 8.6 SAO 39578.  The classification of this group as a true cluster is doubtful.

This galaxy (U03062 = M+00-12-036 = Z393-027) is a poor match with d'Arrest's position of 04 
30.2 -00 32 (2000), although Harold Corwin notes "d'Arrest's position quoted in the NGC is 
bad".  U3062 is identified as N1586 in RNGC, UGC and CGCG but not MCG.

In CGCG corrections, Thomson states that this identification is incorrect as very close to 
d'Arrest's position is a very faint gx, IC 371, recorded by Bigoudan.  But, Corwin claims that 
Bigourdan's position for IC 371 falls on a faint star. U03062 is by far the brighter galaxy, fits the 
NGC description of nearby stars but is 13' NE of the NGC position, so either ID is plausible.  My 
visual observation was verified on the POSS at UC Berkeley.

04 31 38.7 -04 35 18

See observing notes for N1599.  The NGC identification is very uncertain.

Discovered by Leavenworth (II).  Not found by Bigourdan. There is no galaxy at Leavenworth's 
position and RNGC identifies N1610 = NPM1G -04.0203 at 04 34 13.9 -04 41 59 (2000).  This 
galaxy is not in MCG, RC3 or ESGC. Leavenworth's position is 1m 21 tsec W and 7' N of this 
galaxy (not an unusual error although the declinations are generally fairly accurate).  Another 
possibility is N1610 = N1599 which is at the same declination but ~1 tmin of RA preceding 
Leavenworth's position.  But Corwin notes this galaxy has a bright star 1.1' ENE which would 
probably have been mentioned by Leavenworth.

HC: NGC 1610 is probably one of the faint nebulae in the NGC 1600 group -- but which one?  
There is nothing at Leavenworth's position, and his description (m = 15.5, D = 0.2 arcmin; R, 
bMN) could match any of the several fainter members of the group.  

Among the more likely candidates are NGC 1599, and RNGC 1610.  N1599 is at the same 
declination and is just over a minute of time preceding the nominal place of N1610.  However, it 
has a bright star just 1.1 arcmin east-northeast which Leavenworth would almost certainly have 
mentioned had he seen this galaxy. The RNGC identification is also possible, but is 7 arcmin 
south and 1.4 minutes of time following Leavenworth's place.  Neither of these options is 
particularly compelling, but are still worth noting.

17.5" (12/9/01): striking group of ~40 stars within 15' including a number of mag 9 stars.  Many 
of the brighter stars are arranged in a "boat" shape with the bottom of the boat consisting of a 
string oriented NW-SE.  In the middle is a mast, perpendicular to the longer stream of stars.  The 
"mast" primarily consists of a bright quadruple (one with a fainter companion) of mag 8-10 stars 
(h684) with sides less than 1'.  This group may be a scattered group of bright stars.

17.5" (2/3/03): at 140x, ~20 stars are resolved in a scattered 6'-7' group.  Includes a shallow arc 
of three brighter mag 10 stars on the SW side which may not be cluster members. Most of the 
mag 12-13 stars are concentrated in a 3' subgroup on the N side. Stands out reasonably well in 
the field although this group has been listed as a "possible open cluster remnant"  - Bica et al., 
2001A&A...366..827B.  The Lynga position, DSFG, N2000, SC 2000 and RNGC all place the 
cluster too far west by ~45 tsec of RA.

N1663 = VIII 7 = GC 906 was discovered by WH on 10 Feb 1783: "A Cl. of L. and S. sc. st. not 
rich."  There is no grouping at his offset of 4m 0s preceding, and 1d 7' south of 4 Orionis.  But 
Brent Archinal found that a concentration of stars (~30 stars in 9') which is 1 tmin following H's 
position (see e-mail of 7/26/96).  The Lynga position, DSFG, N2000, SC2000 and RNGC all 
place the cluster too far west at 04 48.6 +13 09 and the symbol is plotted incorrectly on U2000.

In Sue French's column of 02/05, she mentions this may be an "open cluster remnant.  Such 
remnants are the residue of old clusters that have lost most of their members."

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this gorgeous barred spiral appeared very bright 
and large with the main body elongated E-W, ~3.5'x2.0'.  An obvious spiral arm is attached at the 
east end of the E-W central bar.  This arm hooks to the north, wrapping around a superimposed 
star to the NE of the bar (1.6' from the center).  Three fainter stars with separations ~30" are 
sandwiched to the west of this star, between the arm and the bar. The arm fades out before 
reaching a mag 10 star 2.2' NE of center.  A second arm begins to emerge on the west side of the 
bar, barely sweeping towards the south before abruptly terminating.  So the second "arm" is just 
a small hooking appendage off the west end.  The central bar itself is sharply concentrated with a 
dramatic, brilliant nucleus, ~25" diameter, that increases gradually to the center.

13.1" (2/19/04 - Costa Rica): fairly bright, fairly large, elongated 3:2 ~E-W, ~3'x2'.  Sharply 
concentrated with a very small, bright core, ~20" diameter, and a large oval halo.  Spiral 
structure was evident as an ill-defined extension or haze off the NE side, though I could not 
resolve this spiral arm clearly.  Situated directly between two mag 9 stars 10' SW and 6.5' ENE.  
This galaxy is a member of the Dorado group which includes N1515, N1533, N1536, N1543, 
N1546, N1553, N1566, N1574, N1596, N1617 and IC 2056. Possible additional members

18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this striking spiral galaxy appeared fairly bright 
and large, ~4' diameter, sharply concentrated with a very bright core.  Clearly emerging from the 
east side of the oval core or bar was a spiral arm which curled north and wrapped around two 
stars to the NW of the core.  The extension on the west side was just a very faint, diffuse haze on 
the SW side without arm structure.  A mag 9 star is 6.5' ENE and a mag 6.5 star (HD 30790) is 
13' NE.

examined Stone's discovery sketch and confirms that N1692 = E552-G21 = M-03-13-029.  This

18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): first of three clusters with nebulosity including 
N1722 + IC 2111 4' NE and N1727 8' NE.  At 128x it appeared as an irregularly shaped, 4' 
nebulous haze just north of an attractive mag 10.7/11.5 double star (17").  A half dozen faint 
stars are embedded in the haze besides the two brighter stars at the south edge. This is a young 
LMC cluster.

18" (7/9/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the first of three nebulous clusters with 
N1722 3.9' NE and N1727  7.7' NE.  N1712 appears as a fairly large knotty region of stars and 
possible weak nebulosity, ~4' diameter.  A mag 10.7/11.5 double (separation 17") is at the south 
edge.

N1758 cluster is close NE (though probably unrelated physically).  Modern catalogues apply 
N1746 to the entire cluster (see description), although N1750 (from William Herschel) and 
N1746 (from d'Arrest) are either identical or just parts of the same cluster.

13": group of fainter stars, just SE of open cluster N1746.

Discovered by WH (VIII 43).  The NGC position is a perfect match for this subgroup of N1746, 
although Corwin has suggested that possibly WH made a 10' error in the declination in which 
case N1750 is identical to N1746 instead of a subgroup.  Reinmuth claims this to be the central 
group in a very large cluster also containing N1746 and N1758.

In an 02/05 S&T article, James Kaler mentions that "N1750 and N1758 are probably two 
different clusters separated along our line of sight by 500 light years, but they appear to fall 
almost directly atop each other"

13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): this emission nebula and cluster is set in fascinating field of several 
clusters and HII regions including N1761, N1769, N1773.  The nebula is fairly bright, large, very 
elongated WSW-ENE, 4'x2'.  A few stars are superimposed on the nebulosity.  The roughly oval 
outline is irregular and the HII region appears brighter on the WSW side near a rich group of 
stars at the WSW tip.  A couple of mag 11 stars are close off the NE end. IC 2115 and IC 2116 
comprise the western and eastern portion of this object.  After viewing this group of objects, the 
LMC which was well past the meridian disappeared behind some low clouds.

Discovered by WH (III 268).  N1781 = III 268 is identical to Leavenworth's N1794 although H's 
RA for N1781 was 3.0 tmin too far W.  Caroline Herschel's position was correct (given in the

15' S.

Discovered by JH (h2731) in LMC.   His single observation placed this cluster at 05 00 17.3 -65

18" (1/1/08): very interesting, bright reflection nebula at 175x.  Two brighter stars are involved 
in the brightest portion of the nebula with a mag 10 star (very unequal double) at the NW end.  
An oval glow extends ~4'x2.5' to the SE and contains a bright "knot" that surrounds a mag 11.5 
star on the SE side.  Two fainter stars are embedded within the glow and form a rhombus with 
the brighter stars at opposite ends.  The SW edge of the main body has a sharper edge (due to 
dust).  Surrounding this region are faint extensions that significantly increase the total size to 
~8x6'.  Towards the SE, dim haze can be seen as far as a 2' pair of mag 12.5 stars.  Broad, wispy 
extensions appears to feather off to the NE for ~6' with additional faint haze to the south. The 
entire complex is bounded by several mag 8-9 stars forming a striking star field.

17.5" (2/9/02): at 144x this is a bright reflection nebula involving two mag 10 and 11.5 stars.  
The nebulosity is irregularly bright in a 4'x3' region elongated NW-SE and locally very bright in 
a knot surrounding the mag 11.5 star near the SE end.  Enhanced by a Deep Sky filter at low 
power.  The brighter mag 10 star ~2' NW has a faint companion and is also encased in the glow 
as well as a couple of other fainter stars.  A faint extension fans out to the NE from the mag 11 
star and some haze is suspected to the south, increasing the size to  ~7' and involving a few 
additional stars.  N1788 is located within a bright trapezoid consisting of three mag 8.5-9 stars 
and a mag 10 star (sides of 9'-13')

17.5" (12/23/89): bright, fairly large, locally very bright surrounding a mag 12 star on the south 
end.  This star appears slightly nonstellar as difficult to separate from bright haze.  Extends NW 
to include a mag 10 star and three other faint stars are involved in the brightest portion.  Very 
faint nebulosity also extends to N and further E.

Discovery attributed to Stone (list I) in NGC.  Stone's rough position is typically poor although 
Howe's corrected position in the IC 2 notes is a perfect match with E553-007 = M-03-14-002.  
This galaxy was actually discovered earlier by WH (III 268 = N1781) but with very poor 
coordinates (see notes to NGC and Dreyer's Scientific Papers of WH).  This galaxy is identified 
as N1781 in U2000 and N1794 in MCC and RC3.  By historical precedence, the primary

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 350x in the 24" I was stunned by the view of 
this huge, extremely bright cluster!  The outer halo, which extends 5' in diameter, was resolved 
into dozens of faint stars in irregular star chains that appear to stream out of the core.  A single 
brighter mag 13 star is superimposed on the west side.  The center is highly concentrated with an 
extremely bright 1' core that appears elongated, irregular and clumpy with a curved outline.  A 
small, 20" diffuse glow is embedded at the N edge of the halo (open cluster S-L 260).  N1850 
resides in a glorious LMC region that is packed with an unbelievable number of clusters and HII 
regions including N1854 6' SE and a huge cluster and nebulosity N1858 about 10' SE.

18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): After the Tarantula region (30 Doradus 
complex), N1850 is the brightest star cluster in the LMC and at an estimated age of only 40-50 
million years, this rich, globular-like cluster has no counterpart in the Milky Way!  At 128x, this 
rich globular-like cluster appeared very bright (9th magnitude), large, round, ~3.5' diameter.  
Well concentrated with an intensely bright 1' core.  A brighter mag 13 star is superimposed on 
the western side of the halo. Several very faint stars are resolved in the very lively halo.

N1850 lies in a very impressive region of the LMC (near the outskirts of the central bar) with 13 
additional NGC clusters/nebulosity within 30' including N1854 7' SE, N1858 10' SE, N1856 22'

Discovered by Dunlop according to Wolfgang's Steinicke's Historical NGC table.  John Herschel 
(h2783) notes that "this obs must refer to the general cluster in which the former (h2782 = 
N1854) is situated as a nebulous-looking knot."  Described as N1854-1855 by David Allen (40") 
as "seen as a single cluster 2' across, 50 stars notes, possibly some nebulosity."  Listed as N1854 
= N1855 in ESO and RNGC.

Hartung describes 1850-1854-1855 as a "beautiful field contains 3 star clusters within 12' of each

it were isolated, but is even more striking situated at the SE end of a wonderful chain with the 
bright cluster N1854 and N1850, one of the top showpieces in the LMC.  At 346x about two 
dozen stars were superimposed over an elongated glow and many other stars are just outside the 
glow.  At 200x with a UHC filter, the nebula is very bright overall with a 30" very high surface 
brightness patch at the N end.  The nebula is brightest along the W and E border and weaker in 
the center.  The elongation is towards a mag 12 star on the south side.  N1854 lies 4.5' NW.

There is a bright knot attached near the NW edge, ~15"-20" in diameter.  This knot responds 
very well to a UHC filter at 76x (27 Panoptic).  An obvious elongated patch of nebulous haze 
curves to the SE with several mag 13 stars involved with the glow and extended N-S.  Overall, 
the size of the cluster/nebulosity extends to 3.5'x2'.  Located 4.5' SE of N1854.

658), he described this object as "a fine L cluster of scattered stars which fills the field.  The 
point taken is the middle of 3 groups [including N1871 and 1873] in the most condensed part."  
So, he was referring to the entire field as N1869.  Located 11.5' S of mag 4.9 Theta Doradus.

Discovered by JH (h2798) along with N1871 and N1873.  N2000, ESO and Morel's Visual Atlas 
of the LMC all identify N1869 with a small cluster flanked by N1871 to the S and N1873 to the 
N at JH's position.  JH's description for h2798 reads: "cluster a 7th class; a fine L cluster of sc st 
which fills field.  The point taken is the middle of 3 groups in the most condensed part."

Jenni Kay notes that "I am confident the small cluster centrally positioned between N1871 and 
N1873, being 2.5' in size is not JH's cluster.  The whole star group is attractive enough to warrant 
it's own designation. ...the small OC was used to measure a position only for the whole group 
which is the true N1869 JH cluster.

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): a long, curving chain of stars extends to the NE 
of the N1874/76/77 HII complex and ends at an easy pair of mag 12 stars that are located about 
2.5' NE of the globular N1872.  At 260x, faint haze, ~1' in diameter, encompasses this pair of 
stars.

Although there is dim nebulosity generally north and west of the double, John Herschel's 
description and sketch refers to an asterism of 5-6 faint stars 2.5' following the pair of stars.

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this large, bright cluster or star cloud contains 
the variable S Doradus (8.6-11.5), the brightest star in the LMC and one of the brightest known 
stars (absolute mag -9).  At 200x, roughly 100 stars mag 11-15 were resolved in a 7' region with 
some extensions increasing the diameter another couple of arc minutes.  S Dor is the brightest

a small, bright knot (S-L 360) that is clearly non-stellar and surrounded by a thin, fainter halo 
(ring of faint stars on DSS).

The cluster is embedded in a very large, bright emission nebula (LMC N119).  The most 
prominent section of the nebula is a very bright 3' patch to the east of S-L 360 and a wing to the 
south of S-L 360 that responds well to a UHC filter at 200x.  Nebulosity is also visible on the 
west side of S Dor.  This section curves N-S to S-L 360 and also south of S Dor.  To the south of

24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this object is the furthest NE in a gorgeous field 
of stars and HII regions.  N1937 is a large nebulous patch, ~3.7'x2.7' in size, with ~20 stars 
resolved over the bright glow.  Excellent contrast gain using a UHC filter at 200x.  The cluster 
includes a string of stars oriented WSW-ENE that passes through the center including a mag 11 
star.  N1936, a very bright nebulous glow, lies 5' S, and other sections of the N44 superbubble 
complex (see http://www.universetoday.com/am/publish/gemini_interstellar_cavern.html) lie to 
the SW including N1929, N1935 and IC 2126.  Superimposed on this complex of HII glows is a 
fairly rich concentration of stars.

24" (4/4/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): very bright, large, round, contains a large, very 
bright core surrounded by a fainter halo with a total diameter of ~3'.  Within the brighter 2' core 
is a sharply concentrated brighter nucleus.  This is an impressive S0 or E-galaxy at 200x due to 
the high surface brightness core and several brightness levels.  On images, the disc is bisected by 
an equatorial dust lane similar to Centaurus A, though this feature wasn't noticed.

Discovered by JH (h2855).  JH's dec is 1 degree south of E085-087 although this identification is 
certain (noted by Lindsay).  In a paper on LMC clusters, Kontizas et al incorrectly lists KMH90-
878 = N1947 probably because of this 1 deg error in NGC, although there does not appear to be a 
cluster on GSC or DSS at the Kontizas position.

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is a large, well-resolved star cloud, ~6' 
diameter, with a roughly diamond shape.  Approximately 60 stars were resolved at 260x over 
haze.  A fairly large, nebulous knot (LMC N48B) was visible on the SW side, ~1.2' diameter, 
and it responded well to a UHC filter.  A couple of other very small knots or clumps of stars 
were visible at the center (LMC N48A and N48C).  Supernova remnant LMC N49 lies 11' NNE.

13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x this is a fairly large star group in the LMC.  Over a dozen

24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the first in a group of clusters including 
N1958, 59, 69, 71, 72 and 86.  These clusters reside in a dense part of the LMC bar.  N1950 
forms the SW vertex of a triangle with N1959 5.5' ESE and N1958 6.3' NE.  At 260x it appeared 
moderately bright, fairly large, ~2' diameter, with a relatively low surface brightness.  At 346x, 
several extremely faint stars pepper the surface of the cluster.  A mag 11 star lies 3' E, within the

V = 8.5;  Size 6x4

18" (2/23/06): at 225x the shape was quite elongated and irregular and the interior had a 
turbulent appearance due to a very irregular surface brightness.  The periphery has a tattered or 
ragged edge and changes shape somewhat with averted vision.  With a UHC filter, there is a 
brighter knot (sometimes appears as an extended, elongated feature) near the SW edge.  Easily 
visible as a faint, oval patch in 15x50 IS binoculars.

17.5" (2/8/86): very bright, unusual potato shape with an irregular surface brightness, 6'x4', 
broad concentration towards center.  Very irregular elongated shape with extensions or "arms" 
towards the NW and SE, ragged edges at periphery.  A large dark indentation or "bay" intrudes 
on the NE side of the SE extension, so this end is thinner and less prominent.  A few faint stars 
are superimposed.  Using an OIII filter, the overall structure is muted but a bright inner streak is 
visible in the SW quadrant (oriented ~E-W) and this streak is not noticeable without the filter. 

13.1" (1/18/85): large, bright, irregular potato shape, large indentation on following end.  Easy in

couple of dozen very faint, densely packed stars.  The 1' halo appeared irregular and mottled as if 
more stars were just below resolution.  A number of clusters are nearby and N1958 forms the 
northern vertex of an isosceles triangle with N1959 5.5' S and N1950 6.3' SW.  A single brighter

Excellent contrast gain using the UHC filter which increased the visibility to a prominent glow.

likely an asterism.  Roughly 10' diameter with a string of stars on the south side trailing to the 
east.  Includes several mag 10-11 stars with two mag 8 stars (oriented N-S) on the N side of the 
low power field.  Described by John Herschel as forming a "3" shape.  Listed as a nonexistent 
cluster in the RNGC and as IC 2135 in NGC 2000.0 which is located about 12' following.

Discovered by JH (2861) and described as "the cusp of a cluster of stars, 8...11m; arranged pretty 
exactly in a figure of 3 with appendages.  *8 in cusp taken."  This group of stars stands out fairly 
well on GSC although the brightest star is closer to mag 10.

Incorrectly identified in RC 3 and N2000 as the galaxy IC 2135 with major axis 3.5', although 
JH's description below clearly refers to a group of stars and his position corresponds with a mag

24" (4/7/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this number refers to one of the multiple 
components of a large star cluster and HII complex, ~5' in diameter.  At 346x this is a small, 
bright glow on the NE side that surrounds three stars, elongated WNW-ESE, ~40"x15".  Fainter 
nebulosity is attached extending to the west for 1.5' and connecting to the knot N1965.  A mag 
9.9 star lies 1.2' S.  This HII complex is located roughly 12' S of a mag 6.1 star (6.7/7.0 pair at a 
close 1.4").

At 200x using a UHC filter, this is a fascinating emission complex as the entire 5' region is 
awash in bright nebulosity and there are faint, irregular extensions beyond the main portion, 
particularly to the north (the outer portions form a faint bubble on images).  A 10th mag star is 
involved, though the cluster itself (S-L 476) does not stand out significantly.

John Herschel referred to N1966 in one observation as "the third of a group of 4 nebulae" 
(referring to this knot) but also as "a pL irreg cluster" centered on the mag 10 star mentioned 
above.  So, N1966 is sometimes applied to the small knot described above or the entire complex

18" (2/24/06): spectacular view at 565x.  The bright mag 10.5 central star appears slightly offset 
east of center, though this may be an optical affect due to the Bok globule on the west side.  The 
bright, 2' reflection nebula is slightly brighter just following the central star.  The irregular dark 
vacuity is large and detailed at this power and appears anvil-shaped.  The base of the anvil is 
along the western side and oriented N-S.  There is a narrow extension to the south that tapers to a 
wedge.  Along the north side, the globule extends to the east and partially wraps around the 
central star.  This was the first time I've seen the globule take on an appearance similar to the 
well-known HST image. 

17.5" (2/22/03): remarkable, bright 2' reflection nebula surrounding mag 10.5 V380 Orionis

Just 0.9' N is SL-538, a small, moderately bright glow that was sandwiched between a brighter

~25" diameter.  Interestingly, John Herschel's two positions for N2006 on different sweeps 
correspond closely with each cluster, so he apparently viewed both (quite similar in the eyepiece) 
and the pair should apply N2006.  Herschel didn't note this object as double, though, so he 
probably felt both were the central part of the "extremely rich assemblage of stars and clustering 
groups which fill the field."

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is a fascinating, showpiece HII complex 
with a cluster and a large, detailed nebula appearing like a fainter version of M8 -- of course, in 
another galaxy!  At 200x the cluster (S-L 533) is ~8' in diameter and includes a couple of dozen 
mag 11-15 stars.  The stars are involved in the glow of a bright HII complex that has an excellent 
response to a UHC filter.  Using the filter, the brightest region (N2018) is a very prominent 1' 
circular patch on the east end with fainter wings extending north and south, increasing the size to 
3'x1'.  A wide pair of stars including a brighter star (HD 269676) is at the west edge of this patch.  
Three additional elongated patches (each 1' to 1.5' in diameter) are strung out in a NW to SE line 
along the SW side of the complex (BSDL 2005, 2048 and 2120).  Another glowing patch of 
nebulosity, ~45" diameter, is to the west of of the brightest region and surrounds a couple of 
brighter stars.  Finally there is an isolated, elongated patch on the north end of the complex that 
seems detached (BSDL 2129).  Weaker sections of the nebulosity give the impression of dark 
lanes.  Surprisingly, Herschel's description applies only to the brightest region at the east end of 
this entire complex.

NW and S-L 585 at 10' NW.  N2042 is located just 17' NW of the center of the Tarantula

the asterism is a mag 7.2 orange star at the NE vertex with an 11th magnitude companion

13.1" (2/25/84): extremely faint, suspected reflection nebula 5' WNW of M78.  Sighting 
uncertain as only visible fleetingly.  [It's not clear from my description whether I observed the 
very low surface brightness circular patch NW of M78 or the brightest portion of the streamer 
pointing towards N2064].

Discovered by Tempel (I).  According to Corwin, "NGC 2067 is a part of the large complex of 
nebulae around M78 = N2068. Found by Tempel, neither the position nor the description makes 
it really clear as to which part of the nebula he saw. The first position I give in the main table is 
for a large patch of pretty low surface brightness nebulosity about 5 arcmin northwest of M78. 
But this is not the brightest nebulosity in the area. That is a knot about 3 arcmin southwest, the 
brightest part of a long faint streamer pointed toward NGC 2064. This, however, is much more 
east than north of M78, while Tempel says that M78 is to the south.  So, a bit of a mystery here -
- which part of the nebulosity was Tempel refering to? I've stuck with the larger more northerly 
end of the nebula, but could well be wrong, so have also put the southern knot in the main table."

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia):  The Tarantula nebula was simply unreal at 200x 
in the 13mm Ethos with a UHC filter -- better than any photo I've seen and convincingly 3-
dimensional, even though I viewed it late so the elevation was only 20°.  Although this 
magnification brought out an unbelievable amount of detail in the loops and ribbons, the main 
complex fit snugly in the eyepiece field (30').

20" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): the Tarantula is the largest known emission 
region (800-1000 light years) and is easily visible to the naked-eye from Australia.  The view of 
the Tarantula early in the morning through a 20" f/5 at 127x (20 Nagler) and OIII filter was jaw-
dropping!  Near the center are several bright loops and arcs.  Extending out are a number of 
convoluted loops including one heart-shaped arch which is quite large.  Running out from the 
central region of the nebula are streaming lanes of nebulosity.  One in particular extends quite a 
long distance and the outer loops and streamers seem to merge into some of the nearby HII 
regions forming a mind-boggling complex.  There are perhaps 10 different loops and ribbons in 
the main body giving a 3-dimensional effect.  Near the center lies an extremely compact cluster 
of superluminous stars (R136) but only a few were visible including what appears to be a single 
bright star.  Also a number of additional stars are scattered about the main body.

12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): first view of the Tarantula in Les Dalrymple's 12" was early in 
the evening, very low in the southern sky (20° elevation) and without a filter.  Even under these 
conditions it was a fascinating sight - fairly bright, detailed, 15' convoluted, mottled nebulosity 
with several striking loops or ribbons which radiate out from the central region.  Sweeping in the 
nearby fields I ran across numerous small knots of nebulosity and small clusters.

24" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): I returned to this detailed nebula the following 
night to make a complete observation at 200x using a UHC filter.  N2084 forms the SE region of 
the complex and it's composed of several nearby components.  At the NE end of this extended 
region is a moderately bright, round knot, ~45" diameter (N159G).  Without a filter a star is 
involved with this glow.  The second, brighter embedded "glow" is close WSW on a direct line 
with N2079.  This knot (N159C-east) corresponds with John Herschel's position for N2084 and 
appeared very bright, fairly large, elongated, ~1.2'x1.0'.  Removing the filter a couple of stars are 
involved (with one brighter star).  A fainter stream of nebulosity connects this glow with another 
glowing knot in essentially the center of the entire complex, 1.5' W of N2084 (N159C-west).  
This third knot is fairly bright, moderately large, round, 45" diameter.

24" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the SE component of a fascinating 4' HII 
complex filled with up to 8 distinguishable knots (4 have NGC numbers) with several of the 
brighter knots forming an "S" shape (this knot is at SE end of the "S").  At 200x and UHC filter 
it appeared very bright, round, fairly large glow, 1' diameter and encased within fainter nebulous 
haze that extends to the west.  N2083 lies 1.5' NNW within the background glow that envelopes 
the entire complex.

24" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): part of an amazing field of nebulous glows 
located ~35' SSE of the Tarantula Nebula and an outlying part of the same huge complex.  At 
200x using a UHC filter the field is divided up into three main groups with N2085 and N2086 
forming a close 1.2' E-W pair separated by a mag 10 star.  A larger, brighter region consisting of 
N2077 and 2078 lies ~2.5' NW and an impressive cluster of nebulous knots (N2078, 2079, 2083 
and 84) is roughly 6' SSW.  With a UHC filter N2085 appears bright, fairly small, ~25" diameter. 
A mag 10 star is just off the NE end (23" from the center).  Forms a close pair with N2086 = IC 
2145, a similar knot just 1.2' E.  Both of these knots are immersed in small, much fainter 
nebulous halos but the bright star itself does not appear to be involved.

24" (4/9/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is the eastern component of a close pair of 
nebulous glows with N2085 just 1.2' W.  This pair is part of a fascinating group of numerous 
emission nebulae just 35' south of the Tarantula nebula.  At 200x with a UHC filter, this knot 
appears very bright (slightly brighter than N2085), fairly small, round, ~30" diameter.  Without a 
filter a faint star is near the center.  Located just 1' E of mag 10 HD 269953 which is nearly 
attached to N2085.

A mag 11 star is at the S tip of the bright portion and a small very faint extension appears S of 
this star.  Located 3' W of mag 9 HD 41787.  Two mag 13 stars are 1' NE and 1' N and a mag 10 
star is 5' S.  An evenly matched mag 10.5/10.5 double at 12" separation lies 8' WSW.  This 
reflection nebula doesn't respond to a Daystar 300 or OIII filter.  Listed as nonexistent in the 
RNGC due to an error in declination in the NGC.  Plotted as Ced 62 in U2000.

Discovered by Stephan at the Marseilles Observatory.  In compiling the NGC, Dreyer 
accidentally used the declination of NGC 1741.  Dreyer later caught and corrected his error in 
the IC 2 Notes/Corrections section (Dreyer added the comment "my mistake"), but the correction 
was missed  by later cataloguers. As an example, in 1922 Edwin Hubble called it "A bright, 
uncatalogued nebula similar to NGC 2245" and Sven Cederblad listed his entry for #62 an 
"anonymous" object with no NGC or IC designation.  So, both were obviously thrown off by 
Dreyer's mistake.

Skiff recomputed Stephan's original position using precise coordinates for his offset star HD 
41787 as 06 04 53.62 +18 40 08.7 (1950).  At this exact location is the reflection nebula 
Cederblad 62 at 06 04 53.17 +18 39 55.0 just 0.45 tsec of RA and 13".7 in declination from 
Stephan's original coordinates!  Besides the excellent positional match, Stephan described NGC 
2163 as "elongated with *11 attached south" and visually this nebula appears to extend more 
prominently north of the mag 11.5 (central) star.  On the POSS, Ced 62 is an interesting bipolar 
nebula with two symmetrical funnel-shaped jets extending north-south from the central star.

More recently, Cederblad 62 wasn't referenced as a NGC object in the first edition of the 
Uranometria 2000.0, Sky Atlas 2000.0 or the Sky Catalogue 2000.  The RNGC lists this object 
as nonexistent and furthermore reverses the sign of the declination.  In addition, a poor RA  was 
given for Ced 62 in Sky Catalogue 2000 and it was misplotted on the U2000 too far E (position 
corrected In U2000 V2).

17.5" (1/16/02): at 64x and OIII filter, this is a beautiful, detailed nebulosity surrounding a mag 8 
star (SAO 78049), extending at least 20' diameter.  The OIII filter gives a dramatic contrast gain.  
With averted vision and careful viewing, the outer borders extend to ~25'.  Structure includes 
interior streaky dark lanes visible to the west of the star.  The rim is slightly brighter or has a 
higher contrast on the western edge but slightly more nebulosity is visible on the following side 
of the star.

Without a filter at 64x, I was surprised to immediately notice a moderately bright 3' round glow, 
situated ~11' NNW of SAO 78049 near the NW edge of the main glow.  Interestingly, this patch 
of nebulosity is more prominent than the main body without a filter and is probably the section 
of the HII complex visually discovered by Stephan!  It seemed quite strange that this patch had 
such a different filter response and dimmed significantly with the OIII (mainly reflection 
component?).  A curving arc of stars is situated along the north side of the glow.  The entire 
nebula is situated among a scattered group of stars, which is often mistaken for N2175.  Located 
1.4 degrees ENE of Chi(2) Orionis.

17.5" (2/28/87): very large, irregular nebulosity surrounding mag 8.0 SAO 78049.  Dark lanes 
are evident west of the star, appears very streaky.  A bright small unresolved knot is 3.2' ENE of 
the bright star using an OIII filter [this is N2175]. 

13" (1/18/85): very bright with filter, very large, surrounds a mag 8 star, sky very dark off W 
side.  West of the star the nebula is mottled and streaky with a bright region near the N edge.

N2174 was discovered by Stephan (Object #7, List IX, Comptes Rendus, vol 87, p. 869).  His 
description does not describe the entire nebulosity or a scattered cluster but rather a small patch 
of nebulosity (without the accents): "excessive., excess., faible (a peine observable); a l'interieur 
d'un triangle forme par trois petites etoiles".

He gives a 1878 position of 06 02 07.47, +20 40 54.4 which precesses to 06 09 24.0 +20 39 53 
(2000), and falls on the NW side of the nebula.  This probably needs a small correction in 
declination based on his reference star, but is still accurate enough to clearly identify a small 
brighter patch of nebulosity.  His three stars are mag 13-14 in GSC and the knot of nebulosity is 
quite prominent on DSS just following the middle of these three stars.  This star has a GSC 
position of 06 09 21.9 +20 39 30 (2000) and Stephan's knot appears only 30"-40" in diameter.

17.5" (12/23/97): this close pair of mag 13/14 stars was picked up at 100x just south of a mag 10 
star.  At 220x and 280x this double star was cleanly resolved [10" separation] although the 
region between the pair and the bright star (just 30" from the southern star) appeared slightly 
hazy, probably due to two additional very close faint stars just below resolvability. At 410x, at 
least one very faint sparkle was occasionally glimpsed close to the mag 10 star.  It is not difficult 
to see why Lohse may have suspected this object to be nebulous.  Coincidentally, a very faint 
reflection nebula (GN 06.11.5) is located 6.7' NNW and it is identified as N2195 in RNGC.

Lohse's position is 17 tsec W of a double star (with two additional very faint stars in a chain).  
His description of a mag 10 star 30" north, pins down this identification.  Interestingly, on my 
first observation of this object, I also thought it was nebulous - either due to glare from the mag 
10 star or the closeness of the chain of the stars.  Coincidentally, there is a very faint (reflection) 
nebula 6.7' NNE in the same field which was also visible in my 17.5" and this object has the 
same RA as Lohse's original position.  The RNGC has incorrectly picked this object as N2195.  
See NGCBUGS and e-mail discussion on sci.astro.amateur 12/97.

Wolfgang Steinicke has this to say about Lohse: The discoverer was Gerhard Lohse, a German 
working at Scarborough using a 15,5 inch refractor. The object is one of 18 nebulae (from a total 
of 20) Dreyer put into the NGC. Lohse is among the observers with the poorest statistics:  Only 3 
objects are real nebulae (the galaxies NGC 2518, 2565, 6792)! 12 are stars (or asterisms), 3 are 
"not found".  From the existing, NGC 2518 is the faintest, but an easy object with V around 13 
mag a and compact core (in NPM1G).  Due to this, it is questionable, if he really saw GM1-45. 
The description of a 10 mag star 31" N matches the small group. In general Lohse's positions are 
not bad, there are "objects" at the places, but in most cases no nebulae.

18" (3/4/08): Hubble's variable nebula is a striking fan-shaped object, with a mag 12 star at its 
south tip with the nebula extending to the north.  The fan displays a great deal of variation in 
brightness and structure at 300x.  The brightest portion is on the northwest side of the fan, 
though it dims a little near the tip on the west side.  The eastern rim is bright and a sharply 
defined N-S like a thin finger. The nebulosity dims along northern end of the fan and a small, 
wedge-shaped darker area extends into the fan from the north.

13.1" (1/28/84): Hubble's Variable Nebula is bright, small, fan-shaped 2:1 N-S and widest at the 
north boundary.  The nebulosity tapers down towards 12th magnitude R Monocerotis at the south 
tip which appears to have a very small high surface brightness halo.  The western edge (oriented 
NW-SE) is slightly weaker and more curved than the eastern edge which is sharper and straighter 
N-S.  This is an impressive nebula with high surface brightness and interesting structure.

17.5" (12/28/00): besides the bright nebulosity extending SW of mag 4.7 S Monocerotis (15), 
most of the central region of the cluster was set against a weakly glowing background (part of Sh 
2-273).  At the southern end of the cluster (tip of the "Christmas Tree"), this low surface 
brightness glow was more evident and clearly extended beyond the tip towards the SE.  The west 
edge of this weak emission glow forms the eastern border of the Cone Nebula (LDN 1613).  
There is a lack of faint stars within the region of the Cone's dark lane but the lane itself was not 
noticeably darker than the background sky further west.

17.5" (12/30/99): nebulosity was quite prominent to the SW of S Mon as well as a weaker glow 
in the vicinity around ?954 at the south end of the cluster.  At 100x (unfiltered) there appeared 
to be a slightly darker vacuity to the south of this star in the position of the Cone nebula but there 
is no sharp "edge" with the nearby nebulosity.

shape.  A bright multiple star 15 Monocerotis = S Mon (4.7-7.5 at 2.8" and companions) is at the 
base of the tree at the north end of the cluster and is surrounded by several stars.  Easy nebulosity 
is visible which extends 10' SW of S Mon and includes a group of three brighter stars.  At the 
south end of the cluster is the double star ?954 = 7.1/9.6 at 13".  The Cone nebula (not seen) 
extends south of ?954 and "points" towards ?954.

Observer #12 (only a very faint glow around mag 14 central star seen).

Dave Riddle: I saw a small fan shaped nebula with an intricately detailed 'tail' with a 18" 
reflector belonging to Art Russell a few winters ago. Oddly, follow up observations made with 
my 18" reflector at this year's WSP and my observing spot in northern Florida would only reveal 
a small amorphous roundish glow. Is it a 'variable' nebula like Gyul'budagyan's nebula in 
Cepheus?

companion at 7".  Viewed unfiltered at 225x.

17.5" (3/8/02): small but high surface brightness reflection nebula surrounding an unequal pair of 
mag 9.5/12.5 stars at 7" separation.  At 280x, the nebulosity is round and approximately 50" in 
size although it fades smoothly into the background and may be a bit larger.  This small knot of 
nebulosity is at the western end of a striking arc of 6 stars which trail off to the NE.  The next 
star in the arc, 1.5' E, also seems to be encased in a very small halo.  A similar mag 9.5 
comparison star (with no halo) lies 4' ESE and several other mag 9.5-10.5 stars are scattered 
across the field.  The background sky in this vicinity is weakly luminous, as N2327 is situated 
midway along the western side of IC 2177, a huge IC strip of nebulosity straddling Canis Major 
and Monoceros.  This object did not respond to OIII, UHC or H-beta filters so appears to be 
predominantly a reflection nebula.

This bright nebula was discovered by William Herschel (IV 25) in 1785 and reobserved by his 
son, John.  Although their positions and descriptions match this object  there is a great deal of 
confusion in the literature as to its identification and position and some sources misidentify 
N2327 with the much larger Sh 2-292 = Gum 1 located 50' to the north (also associated with IC 
2177).

13" (12/22/84): fairly faint reflection nebula, fairly small, surrounds a mag 8 star (close unequal 
double).  Located along the faint, extremely large, curving strip of nebulosity = IC 2177.

Discovered by WH (IV 25) in 1785.  John Herschel described "a double star whose large star is 
in the center of a very faint nebula which involves the small star also." His position of 07 04 07.6 
-11 19.0 pins down the identification as a compact HII/Reflection nebula on the W side of the 
Seagull Nebula. In 1886, Engelhardt also published an accurate micrometric position of  07 04 
07.77 -11 18 56.6 (J2000).  Howe also noted the central star is double with separation 7".

Despite JH and Englehardt's accurate positions and Herschel's good description, there has been a 
great deal of confusion in the literature as to the identification and position.  SIMBAD's position 
is completely off! (07 09 20.2 -10 20 48).

N2332.  Identifications reversed with N2332 in the RNGC and identified as IC 457 in the 
CGCG/RC3.

In the three Lord Rosse observations of the N2332/N2340 field a total of 9 objects were found 
and sketched.  For some reason the only additional object that Dreyer decided to include in the 
NGC was N2330.  Swift and Kobold later surveyed the field and Dreyer included accurate 
positions for all of Rosse's objects shown on the sketches in the IC.

Since Rosse did not provide positions, Dreyer probably had to rely on Rosse's sketch which 
incorrectly placed N2330 north of N2332 instead of southwest and Bigourdan's positions that 
unfortunately referred to single stars.  N2330 is incorrectly placed 2.4' N of the larger and 
brighter N2332.  N2330 was then properly sketched at a later observation and recatalogued by 
Dreyer as IC 457. Therefore, it is fairly certain that N2330 is identical to IC 457.  The 1950 
positions for these galaxies are:

N2330 = IC 457 = M+08-13-078 = CGCG 234-074     07 05 37.9 +50 13 59  
N2332 = U03699 = M+08-13-079 = CGCG 234-075   07 05 43.7 +50 15 46 

The identifications and positions given in the RNGC are

(R)N2330  07 05.7 +50 16  E, R, BM, DKLNSUSP
(R)N2332  07 05.7 +50 15  E, R, BM, ALMSTEL

Based on the RNGC declinations it is clear the RNGC has reversed the identifications of N2330 
and N2332 making N2330 the brighter northern member of the pair and incorrectly describing 
N2332 as "almstel" (same error in MCG).  So, the data for N2330 and N2332 should be reversed 
in the RNGC. This galaxy is identified as IC 457 in UGC and CGCG.  See RNGC Corrections 
#5.  In the IC 1 notes, Dreyer mentions that Kobold did not find N2330 or N2334 (see AN 
#3184), in his table on the N2332 group.  See NGCBUGS for much more on the story!

N2332 is one of the brighter members of a group of galaxies stretching some 15' E including 
N2340 and a number of IC entries micrometrically measured by Kobold.  WH observed two 
galaxies in the group (II 862 and II 736) which Dreyer listed as N2332 and N2340 in the NGC.  
In Scientific Papers of William Herschel, Dreyer notes regarding II 862, "identification difficult, 
as it is one in a group.  It is probably one of Kobold's nebulae in the IC."  In any case, JH 
definitely observed N2332 = h430 and Dreyer used his correct position in the NGC, so the ID is 
certain.  This galaxy (U03699 = M+08-13-079 = Z234-075) is incorrectly identified as N2330 in

uneven surface brightness and it appears a bit thinner or pinched on the NW side.  Modest 
contrast gain with a UHC filter at 100x-280x, although this object does not require a filter.

13" (1/11/86): bright mag 11.5 central star surrounded by fairly small, round disc.  Located 
between two mag 13 stars 0.8' E and 1.2' W.  View enhanced with Daystar 300 filter.  Central 
star is the variable V651 Mon (mag 11.3-13.5).

S of mag 7.3 SAO 14129.  A mag 10 star lies 5.2' NE.  Forms a wide pair with IC 2179 = UGC 
3750 13' N.

Discovered by WH (III 746).  His original discovery position (with respect to his reference star) 
is 07 16 44 +65 00.7 (2000).  In GC, JH modified his father's position to 07 16 19 +64 48.2 
(2000) although he did not reobserve this gx. This latter position is 16 tsec E and 6' N  (or 9' NE) 
of U03759 = M+11-09-039.

Bigourdan later observed this field in 1894 and 1900. His original position for B267 = IC 2179 
in Comptes Rendus is 07 15 33 +64 57 (2000) which is an excellent match for U03750 = M+11-
09-038a at GSC position 07 15 32.2 +64 55 34 (2000).  CGCG, UGC, MOL, DSFG, RC3, PGC 
and U2000 all identify this galaxy as IC 2179.  His listing in the complete Observations, etc. for 
B267 gives a position of 07 16 06.2 +64 43 01 (2000), which matches U03759, the galaxy 
identified as N2347 in modern catalogues and his listing for N2347 matches U03750 (Corwin 
notes an error in his identification of the reference star).

So, apparently Bigourdan has reversed the identifications here.  Based on his original position it 
is possible that WH's original observation refers to U03750 instead (as Bigourdan claimed).  See 
NGC/IC Bugs and IC identification from Thomson for complete discussion.

match his description "A pretty rich and compressed cluster of stars" other than N2355 10' S of 
his position.  Corwin equates N2356 = N2355 (see description for N2355).  Also about 20' W of 
Herschel's position are 15 stars in a 3' arrowhead outline.  This asterism is well detached in the

11.5-12.5 stars with sides of 1' form the eastern corner of the group.

Discovered by WH (VII 6): "A pretty rich and compressed cluster of stars."  Observed once at 
Birr Castle: "A dozen st scattered loosely over the field."  Reinmuth adds "no Cl n of NGC 2355, 
in 7h 8m.0 +14d 13' (1860) a loose clustering of st 11... in triangle." There is no obvious 
clustering on the GSC to the N of N2355 but at Reinmuth's position (about 1 tmin preceding the 
NGC position) is a triangular group which stands out well!  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC. As 
the NGC position for N2356 is just 12' N of N2355 it seems plausible that WH accidently 
recorded the same object twice.

13x80mm (1/13/07): the circular central region of Thor's Helmet was easily visible at 13x in my 
80mm finder using an OIII filter (24mm Panoptic), though the "horns" of the helmet were not 
seen.

17.5" (12/28/00): "Thor's Helmet" is a remarkably bright, detailed nebulosity at 100x using an 
OIII filter.  The central region is a 5' bubble (illuminated by a Wolf-Rayet star) with a brighter 
rim along the west side giving a "C" appearance with irregular knots, filamentary wisps of 
nebulosity and areas of thinner nebulosity in the interior.  A number of fainter stars are 
superimposed in the central region along with some brighter mag 11 stars on the north portion of 
the rim.  Attached at the south end is a brighter 4' extension elongated towards the west with a  
mag 9 star at its SE side.  This section then thins out into a long 10' streamer which precedes the 
main section and forms the southern "horn" of the helmet.  A second long, thicker streamer is 
attached at the north end of the central mass and extends out to the NW (this piece has been 
misidentified as IC 468). A fainter strip of nebulosity also begins on the north end and extends 
10' due east while weak nebulosity is also east of the central helmet off the south side.  
Illuminated by the Wolf-Rayet star HD 56925 = WR 7.

rich southern portion tapers to the south giving a triangular appearance.  At 220x, ~60 stars are

18" (3/19/04): at the SW end of the galaxy is a very bright knot (HII region), roughly mag 12.5 
and perhaps 15" in size which responds to a UHC filter at 160x!  At 323x this knot is irregular in 
shape (~20"x15", SW-NE) and brightness and at moments resolves into two or three 
components.  The galaxy itself is fairly faint, large, and very elongated SSW-NNE, 3.5'x1.0', 
with a low surface brightness.

13.1" (1/11/86): fairly faint, very large, elongated 5:2 SW-NE, low almost even surface 
brightness.  An unusually bright HII region is at the SW end of the galaxy (2' from the center) 
and appears as a "fuzzy" 12th magnitude star.  Although very small it seems elongated SW-NE 
and similar to a poorly resolved double star.  Definite contrast gain with OIII filter.

Discovered by WH (III 748).  This NGC dec is about 11' too far S.  WH's description "vF, vS, 
has a vF branch nf" actually describes the HII region at the SW end with the main body of the 
galaxy as Herschel's "vf branch nf."  Copeland's description at Birr Castle clearly places the 
surrounding objects (stars and nebulous objects) with respect to the HII region!  Most modern 
sources have incorrectly identified the large HII knot as N2363.

18" (3/4/08): unusual location for a galaxy in a rich Milky Way star field.  At 220x appears fairly 
faint, fairly small, elongated 4:3 SW-NE, low even surface brightness.  A mag 13 star is 
embedded on the south end and a mag 14.7 stars is on the NE side.  Finally, an extremely faint 
mag 15.5 star is occasionally visible close south of the fainter star.

17.5" (2/1/92): faint, fairly small, elongated SSW-NNE, ~1.0'x0.5', low surface brightness, no 
core.  A mag 12 star is attached at the south end and an extremely faint mag 15 star is involved at 
the north end.  Appears diffuse with ill-defined edges and seems similar to a faint nebulosity in a 
rich Milky Way field!  Unusually low galactic latitude for a galaxy.  Incorrectly listed as 
nonexistent in RNGC but plotted on U2000.

Discovered by Stephan (VI).  His position and description exactly matches UGCA 132 although 
listed as nonexistent in RNGC.  Identification given by Corwin.  Correctly identified in RC2 as

were best viewed at 323x: the brightest is the HII complex N2404 on the east side of the core 1.5' 
from center and 1.5' N of a mag 11 star to the SW of the core.  This knot is fairly bright at 323x, 
perhaps 15" diameter and irregularly round.

On the NW side of the halo is a collinear string, consisting of two stars along with a fuzzy knot, 
oriented from SW to NE.  This HII knot (IRAS 07315+6543) forms the SW end of the string and 
is clearly nonstellar at 323x, ~15' diameter.  It can also be pinpointed 2.4' NW of the mag 11 star 
west of the core (middle of 3 in a E-W string).

Discovered by WH (II 822).  JH placed this galaxy at 07 39 27.3 +52 27 03 (1950).  UGC, MCG

(1950) which is a an excellent match with h's position.
 
The RNGC declination is offset exactly 30' too far N and should be changed to +52d 23' (1975).  
Because of the RNGC error, this galaxy is also misplotted on the U2000 atlas.  Copeland

24" (4/4/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): I was amazed how prominent the sweeping 
spiral arms appeared at 260x giving a stunning "S" appearance.  The main bar of the galaxy is 
fairly bright and extended ~2:1 in a SW to NE orientation with a length of ~3'.  The bar has just a 
weak, broad concentration with no real core but it rises sharply at the center to a very small, 
brighter nucleus.  The main arm is attached at the NE end of the bar and extends a short distance 
in that direction before dramatically bending sharply to the west (turning nearly 150°) and 
extending ~3.5' in length towards a mag 12.9 star.  At the NW end this well-defined arm fades 
and broadens a little, terminating just SE of the 13th magnitude star.  At the SW end of the bar, a 
thick arm emerges extending to the SW where it more gently curves around towards the east 
while fanning out.  This arm is not as sharply defined as the inside (east) portion of the curve 
blends with a diffuse glow extending from the bar.  The total distance between the tips of the 
arms spans nearly 5'.  In the same field, 10' ENE, lies ESO 59-11 and N2534 is 16' NNW.  The 
field also includes a number of mag 9 to 11 stars that frame the galaxy.

20" f/5 (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 127x (20mm Nagler), the main body of 
this unusual galaxy appeared as a fairly faint, large, thick "bar" with just a weak concentration 
except for an extremely small bright core. On the NE end of the bar, a faint "arm" emerged at a 
sharp angle towards the NW.  The contrast was improved at 212x and the brighter arm was easier 
to view, extending at nearly a right angle to the main body and curving towards the west on the 
N side.  On the SW end, a broad, short, low surface brightness extension was visible bending 
towards the SE.  The main bar was elongated 2:1 SW-NE, roughly 3'x1.5', but the thick outer 
arm significantly increased the size to ~4.5'x2'.

24" (4/4/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): This number refers to the prominent arm

towards the NW.  The contrast was improved at 212x and the brighter arm was easier to view, 
extending at nearly a right angle to the main body and curving towards the east on the N side.

13.1" (1/30/06 - Costa Rica):  bright, large nebulosity at 75x using an OIII filter, ~4-5' diameter, 
surrounding a mag 7.5 star.  The main section is roughly mushroom shaped, extending generally 
south of the bright star.  The southern border is locally brighter along a strip oriented NW to SE.  
There is a sharp light cut-off (apparently due to dust) passing to the north of the central star and 
oriented E-W.  Faint haze extends 15' to 20' to the east towards a 12'-15' string of brighter stars 
that are oriented NW to SE.  The nebulosity brightens and broadens into a 12' stream roughly 
parallel to this group of brighter stars (catalogued as Haffner 18).  Removing the filter this is a 
gorgeous low power Milky Way field with numerous faint stars superimposed in the region of 
the nebula.

17.5" (3/2/02): Using a 31 Nagler at 64x and an OIII filter, this is a prominent 7' nebulosity 
surrounding a mag 8 star.  A dark lane appears to cut through the nebula from west to east 
starting NW of the central star.  Fainter nebulosity extends beyond the dark lane but then fades 
out to the north.  The south and southeast border of the main mass has a bright, distinct edge and 
the southern border has a small extension on the west edge which hooks towards the NW.

A finger of nebulosity extends from the main body towards the NW and involves a scattered 
group of brighter stars (this is Haffner 18). This strip dims but nearly merges with a much larger, 
elongated mass of fairly faint nebulosity extending NW to SE at a roughly right angle.  This 
section is ~15' in size with an irregular border that is bounded on the NE side by a string of 
brighter stars.  This is a fascinating HII complex to explore in a rich star field!

17.5" (1/23/88): at 82x with OIII filter appears as a large, bright, circular nebulosity about 10' 
diameter.  A mag 7.8 star is involved north of center and several fainter stars are involved.  The 
nebulosity is brightest along the south side in a strip oriented NW-SE.  A group of brighter stars 
is NE (Haffner 18).  A separate larger (~15') but fainter section is 10'-15' NE and appears 
elongated.  

8" (3/24/84): fairly bright, moderately large, roughly circular.  A mag 8 star is north of center.

using the 15x50 IS binoculars.  Fills over half of the 20 Nagler field, 30'-35' diameter with over 
100 stars resolved.  The outline is quite irregular though well-detached at low power.  A mag 5.2 
orange star (HD 66342) lies to the NE of the cluster.  The central region is more concentrated 
and uniform.  Includes a number of tinted yellow or orange stars.  A nice triple (h4027 =

13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): this bright naked-eye cluster is located SW of the "False Cross" (3

It was well resolved in the 9x50 finder.  At 105x, the main group is 25'-30' with outliers 
increasing the size and roughly 100 stars are resolved including a number of mag 6-8 stars.  
Many of the stars are arranged in loops and strings and overall the cluster is quite irregular in 
magnitudes and star distributions.  There is a close, fairly bright double on the SE side (7.2/8.0 at 
5.5") and a neat 13' chain of stars near the west side running N-S.

(NGCBUGS) this error was caused by measuring his offset for N2528 with respect to N2524 
instead of the comparison star used for N2524. Malcolm Thomson feels U04234 should be

13.1" (1/30/06 - Costa Rica): this very large, bright scattered cluster was just visible to the naked 
eye close south of a brighter, hazy naked-eye patch of unresolved stars.  The field is beautifully 
rich, at least 45' diameter though there was no distinct border.  The star field looks impressive 
beyond the edges of the 66' field of the 20 Nagler.  On the NW side is a rich, elongated strip of

unequal mag pair at the SSW end of the elongated strip.

13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): this cluster is a very bright, scattered field of stars that completely 
fills the nearly 40' field at 105x.  Partially resolved in the 9x50 finder.  At the NW edge is a rich 
elongated strip of two dozen stars including a couple of close, unequal pairs and tight fainter 
triple.  John Herschel's description applies to this denser group of stars. A mag 6.4 star (h4051 =

13.1" (1/30/06 - Costa Rica): this naked-eye cluster to the south of Gamma Velorum is roughly 
30'x20' in size.  There is a very distinctive, gently curving arc of stars bowed out to the east that 
defines the eastern side of the central region and the brightest mag 6.5 star is along this arc.  
Three nice pairs are to the W and NW of the mag 6.5 star (one of these pairs has a third fainter 
companion forming a triple).  The main portion of the cluster is enclosed in two outer strings of 
stars that form a large "V" with the vertex to the east of the mag 6.5 star and the pair of strings 
increase the diameter to 30'.  While scanning for NGC 2547 I ran across a bright, distinctive red 
star to the west (probably M3-class HD 67821).

arbitrary.  Very unusual arrangement as a number of the brighter stars form a curving arc which 
is bowed out towards the east and which defines the eastern border of the cluster!  The brightest 
mag 6.5 star is within this arc on the south side of the cluster.  The cluster is encased in faint

also refer to M-01-22-027 (2' E of N2617) though the RNGC new description "companion 1'

possible candidate near his position is a mag 11.7 star 2' S of his position and a group of five 
mag 13.5-14.5 stars close south of the brighter star.  Four of the stars are strung along a 5' gently 
curving arc.  To the NE is a much brighter 10' string of a half dozen stars that extends towards 
the NE.  Neither of these asterisms, though, are probably eye-catching enough to even be 
described by Herschel as a "course cluster".  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.  Corwin 
suggests as another possible candidate a group of about a dozen stars surrounding SAO 42564 at 
08 49 47.4 +44 42 15 (J2000), though this is over two degrees south of Herschel's position. So,

Rosse nova shown on N2684 sketch. This object was not included by JH in GC. It appears that 
RNGC has misidentified this object with an anonymous galaxy about 3.5' too far N (also given in 
SIMBAD), although the rectangular and regular coordinates are contradictory.

Based on the Birr Castle sketch it appears that N2689 applies to an extremely small and faint 
galaxy at 08 55 25 +49 06.9. This galaxy is not listed in CGCG, UGC, MCG, RC3. It is possible 
that M+08-16-040, identified as N2688 in MCG, actually applies to N2689 based on the 
separation values from N2684.  The ID's of N2688 and N2689 are discussed in detail by 
Thomson in Catalogue Corrections and in NGCBUGS.

09 00 17 -45 56.9
Size 30x7;  PA = 20d

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): Herschel's Ray was a striking, bright filament 
at 130x and a UHC or OIII filter, extending SSW-NNE for at least 20' in length.  Herschel's Ray 
is brightest along a 5' stretch at the NNE end as it passes to the west of mag 8.3 HD 774433 and 
continues NNE ending to the west of a mag 9.5 star.  Several very faint stars appear to very close 
to the northern half of the ray, particularly along the eastern edge, though a mag 11.2 star is also 
at the western edge.  The ray weakens or thins to a narrow splinter just the east of this mag 11.2 
star.  At the NNE tip the filament subtly bends very slightly towards the N and at the SSW end 
the filament more obviously curves or hooks slightly towards the south as it fades.

13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): Herschel's Ray was easily picked up at 105x using a UHC filter.  It 
extended well over 1/2 of the 38' field, at least 20'x2', oriented SSW-NNE.  This prominent Vela 
Supernova filament is brightest towards the NNE end near a mag 8.3 star which is just following 
the NNE edge.  It appears like a thin splinter of light through the field with a weak filamentary 
structure and variations in brightness, similar to one of the fainter filaments in the Veil nebula.  
Several stars are very close to the edge including a mag 11 star near the middle.  I was impressed 
the appearance was very comparable to the view I had through the 18-inch in Australia.

18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is an isolated bright eastern filament in the 
Vela Supernova remnant which is centered over 4° to the west.  At 128x and UHC filter (38 
arcmin field), it appears as a fairly faint, thin, nebulous streak extending SSW-NNE over half the 
field, roughly 20'x1'!  The surface brightness is roughly uniform, though the northern portion is 
brighter near a mag 8.3 star off the NE end.  The nebulosity continues past this star and ends 
with a mag 9.5 star due east of the NNE tip.  On the SSW end the nebulosity gradually dims out.  
A few mag 11 stars border the filament, one just off the west edge near the center and a couple 
further south.

On 1 March 1835 JH discovered this object at the Cape of Good Hope and described it as "eeF, 
L, vvmE; an extraordinary long narrow ray of excessively feeble light; position 19 deg±.  At 
least 20' long, extending much beyond the limits of the field...".  This agrees perfectly with the 
ESO-Uppsala listing NGC 2736 = ESO 260-N14, a nebula with dimensions 30'x7', position 
angle of 20° and note "Luminous filament".  Corwin adds that on the ESO IIIa-F film this nebula 
is the brightest patch of a huge supernova remnant whose delicate wisps cover the field (centered 
roughly 5 degrees WNW).  A relatively bright star is immersed in N2736 (mentioned by JH).

RNGC and NGC 2000.0 misclassified this object as a galaxy and I mentioned this error in 
RNGC Corrections #5.  The first reported connection of NGC 2736 with the Vela SNR was in 
2000: http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJL/v543n2/005648/005648.html, 
two years after the discovery of the SNR itself in 1998.  Estimated age of the supernova is 9-
11,000 years.

Size 0.5x0.2;  PA = 80d

17.5" (4/6/02): very faint, small, slightly elongated 0.5'x0.3', ver weak concentration.  Located 3' 
N of a mag 10 star.  A mag 13 star follows by 1'.  This galaxy is the westernmost in the N2744 
group and lies 30' W of N2744.  The NGC identification is uncertain as Marth's catalogued 
position is 1.0 tmin further east (nothing exists there).  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.

Discovered by Marth and placed 22 tsec W and 1' N of m146 = N2745.  There is no object at this 
position and not found by Bigourdan, Carlson and repeated in RNGC.  But Corwin notes that 
exactly 1.0 tmin W of Marth's position is a faint galaxy (Mrk 1221).  The NGC comment about 
being first of two with N2745 was added by Dreyer.  See NGCBUGS.

companion (slightly elongated with a nearly stellar core)!  Howe identifies a wider pair close 
NW as N2757.

Discovered by Muller (list II).  Described as only an eF D*, dist 12" by Howe.  Corwin proposes 
a closer triple star (Muller would have resolved the coarser double) at 09 05 25.7 -19 02 52 (GSC 
has a single star at this position).  I also thought this triple was a nonstellar object in my 
observation of N2758!  See NGCBUGS for story.

09 16 56.7 +20 04 14

18" (3/4/08): this number refers to a single mag 14.5 star 2.4' W of N2809.

18" (2/9/08): this mag 14.5 star was mistakenly thought to be possibly nebulous by Dreyer.  At 
225x it appeared clearly as a faint star.  Located 2.4' W of N2809 and a similar distance NNW of 
N2807.  N2806 is incorrectly identified as MCG +03-24-030 in RNGC, MCG and PGC.

Dreyer's description from 22 March 1876 reads:  "A vF * or cS, eF neb p [N2809] (sky bad), 
forming an equilateral triangle with [2807] and [2809] (susp as neb by d'A, = [N2806])."  At this 
position there is a mag 14.5 star with a GSC position 09 16 56.7  +20 04 14 (2000).  This star 
forms an equilateral triangle with N2807 and N2809 as stated by Dreyer and lies due west of 
N2809.  Since his descriptions and offsets for other objects in the field are exact, there is no 
mistaking the identity of N2806 as a single star.

N2806 was not found by Bigourdan.  Reinmuth apparently describes this star as "eS, R, ? neb 
*13.8, IC 2455 np 2.8', N2809 f 2.6', B double star spp 2.2'."  RNGC, MCG (M+03-24-030), 
DSFG and U2000 misidentify N2806 with an extremely faint companion of N2807 situated just 
preceding the south edge.  This galaxy was highly suspected in my 17.5" although apparently it 
was not seen by Dreyer! (he did note the sky was bad).  This galaxy (MCG +03-24-030 = 
NPM1G +20.0205) should not receive a NGC designation. Discussed in RNGC Corrections #7 
and NGCBUGS.

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x, this was a stunning showpiece 
globular in the 24"!  The central region displays an unusually strong concentration with a super-
intense 2' core that was unresolved.  A very bright, small halo surrounds the core that is mottled 
but mostly unresolved.  The outer halo resolves into perhaps 150-200 stars mag 14.5 and fainter.  
The halo gradually thins out in resolved stars out to 10' diameter. The core was still unresolved at 
350x.  The overall appearance of the three brightness levels mentioned above is unusually 
symmetrical.

13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): this very bright globular is large and elongated, ~8'x6' SW-NE 
increasing to 2' bright core and a blazing 40" nucleus.  At 144x, this cluster is mottled but with 
no obvious resolution.  At 166x a large number of extremely faint stars (mag 14-15) pop in and 
out of view over the entire disc, though the resolved stars could not be held steadily.  Located 
1.8° NNE of mag 4.0 Alpha Volantis.

18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x, this bright globular (ranked 10th 
brightest at V = 6.1) is fairly large, ~10' diameter and very compressed with a blazing 2' core.  
The halo is noticeably elongated, nearly 3:2.  A dense swarm of mag 14 and fainter stars are 
resolved in the halo and around the edges of the core but the inner central core is unresolved.  At 
228x, there appear to be some very faint stars lanes streaming into the halo which are just 
unresolved but look like small tentacles.  A mag 10/10.6 double at 16" is outside the cluster ~10' 
ESE.  This is by far the brightest concentration class I globular and the only one easily resolved.  
Visible naked-eye.

18" (3/30/05): the first object I took a look at was SN 2005am in NGC 2811 discovered on 
February 22, 2005.  The SN peaked near mag 13.5,  but now appears significantly fainter.  
Coincidentally, the SN makes a very close pair with a brighter mag 14.5 star (less than 10").  
Generally only this star was visible, but occasionally I could see a fainter companion close NE.

17.5" (3/25/00): this moderately bright PN is nestled on the west side of the faint but fairly rich 
open cluster N2818.  At 220x it appears moderately bright, irregularly shaped, ~1.0'x0.8' and 
elongated roughly N-S.  Excellent view at 280x with a UHC filter and unfiltered at 380x.  The 
rim is irregularly brighter giving a weak annular appearance.  Appears brightest at the S and SW 
rim.  The center is slightly darker but there is no well-defined central hole. The outline is not 
crisp and seems to change orientation somewhat with averted vision.

as a faint group of 25-30 stars mag 12 to 15 over unresolved haze. This has been assumed to be 
the only planetary to be physically associated with a cluster, although recent research places the 
planetary in the foreground.

18" (3/11/07): not found at 220x.

Discovered by WH (III 64).  PGC 26414 is a good match with the Herschel's position although 
his description is uncertain: "suspected neb, but 240 shewed some S st with suspected nebulosity, 
probably a deception from want of light and power."  The transit was only given to the nearest 
minute, so the NGC position may have come from another source.  This galaxy was not seen by 
Bigourdan and its not included in CGCG, MCG or RC3.  If it was seen by Herschel, I think this 
is one of the faintest galaxies he picked up.

Discovered by John Herschel on April 1, 1834, and described as the "finest planetary nebula I

object might be a new planet as a nearby 15th magnitude star was carefully measured to check 
for relative movement, though none was found on the next night.

Discovered by JH (h599). His RA is 25 tsec E of U05037 = M+04-22-058 = CGCG 121-098 
although it was noted as very uncertain in the Slough catalogue.  The correct position was given 
by Bigourdan and Dreyer as IC 538. So N2885 = IC 538 and IC suggests this equivalence.

The galaxy identified as N2885 in RNGC is CGCG 122-006.  N2885 is misidentified in CGCG 
and UGC as IC 2474. Finally, N2885 is identified in MCG (M+04-22-058) as IC 538 (also in 
PGC errata list).  See WSQJ article, July 1990 and CGCG Corrections as well as Corwin's

24" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): fascinating bipolar planetary at 260x using a 
UHC filter.  A very bright knot is situated on the SW end with fainter extensions along the rim to 
the SE.  A matching knot with a lower surface brightness is on the north side.  This knot is also 
elongated making another short arc.  The planetary is noticeably elongated with dimensions of 
~1.6'x1.0', oriented NW-SE.  At 520x both knots or arcs gradually increase in brightness to their 
centers and occasionally show very faint stellar nuclei.  The overall surface is noticeably mottled 
at this power, though darker in the center.  The open cluster, IC 2488, lies 50' S.

13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x this interesting Vela planetary appeared fairly faint, 
moderately large, slightly elongated ~E-W, 1.3'x1.0'.  Good contrast gain with a UHC filter. The 
surface brightness appears very irregular or mottled with a brighter knot on the SW end that is 
nearly detached and an irregular darker center.  Also a less-defined knot appears to be situated on 
the north end.  Four mag 7.5-9 stars are in the field to the W and N and the PN is situated 9' E of

18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x, this moderately bright planetary is fairly 
large, ~1.5'x1.0', with an irregular shape and surface brightness.  Adding a UHC filter improved 
the contrast and the PN is clearly elongated with an annular or bi-polar appearance with a darker, 
irregular center.  There are two brighter knots or arcs on on the SW and NE sides of the central 
section (minor axis?) with the SW knot more obvious.  Situated in a fairly rich star field with 
four mag 7-9 stars including a mag 7.3 star 9' W.

of 2 Apr 1801.  Corrected positions from Greenwich plates are given in MN, 71, 509 and the 
position for III 963 matches U05115 = M+13-07-032 = CGCG 350-027.  According to the MN 
article, JH's observation of h612 (position given in NGC for N2938) does not refer to III 963 but 
only a faint star.  "The position is clearly indicated by the double star mentioned in the

Discovered by JH (h617).  His RA is exactly 1 tmin W of M+12-10-001+2 = Z332-064 but his 
description of a "*13m near" matches a similar star off the SW edge.  This galaxy is located 3' 
WNW of brighter N2963 which was discovered by his father William and reobserved by John on 
the same night he discovered N2957.  John's offset from N2963 of 32 tsec in RA pins down the 
identification N2957 = M+12-10-001+2 = Z332-064.  Looking over the RNGC data, it is clear 
that the entry for N2957 is simply a duplicate of N2963.  In my observation of N2957 I did not 
resolve the two components.  Listed as N2957A and N2957B in NGCPOS file.  See RNGC

Discovered by WH (III 751).  Unusual description by JH (h 623): "vF, R, bM, filamentous (i.e. 
as if filaments hung round it; an effect probably of diverging lines of small stars, as in M13...). 
There are some faint companions on the south side which he may have glimpsed.

Discovered by WH (III 34).  His position was roughly 1 tmin E and 4' N of UGC 5200. This 
object was observed twice by JH (h633) and he mentioned that the RA and Dec were 
approximate.  Javelle later gave the position correctly as IC 556.  Reinmuth mentioned that he 
couldn't find N2984 in Dreyer's place and questioned if equal to IC 556?  This galaxy is 
identified as IC 556 in the UGC, CGCG and MCG.  So, likely N2984 = IC 556 as there are no 
other reasonable candidates.  See ICBUGS.

24" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 215x, this beautiful, asymmetric face-on 
spiral extended ~7'x4.5' and was sharply concentrated with a very bright 40" core.  The spiral 
structure is unusual with a very long, relatively thick arm that curves from west to east on the 
north side of the core.  This arm then bends south on the west side and contains a very faint 20" 
HII knot which is NW of the core and symmetrically placed opposite a star in the outer halo on 
the SW side.  A fainter star is near the end of this arm, due west of the core.  To the east of the 
end of this arm the light level noticeably dips (this is a gap between the arms) on the south side 
of the galaxy giving an asymmetric appearance.

A second fainter outer arm running roughly SW to NE also wraps around the galaxy on the north 
side but at further distance from the core.  This outer arm nearly reaches a star on the SW side of 
the galaxy (the one opposite the knot mentioned above) and then can be followed with more 
difficulty to the east where it connects on the south side of the core.

Discovered by Muller (II).  His rough RA (nearest tmin) is actually over 11 tmin E of N2979 
(very close in declination) and Corwin suggests a 10 tmin error in RA would make this number a 
duplicate of NGC 2979 (See NGCBUGS).

24" (4/12/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x appears fairly bright, fairly large, 
slightly elongated.  Appears to have a central bar or an elongated core (barred spiral).  At 
moments I caught a glimpse of a faint stellar nucleus.  The halo is large, ~2.5'x2.0' and seems 
mottled.  Surrounded by a number of stars in a rich star field and situated 5' ESE of a mag 9 star.  
I accidentally forgot to check this object off from the previous night so it was still on my 
observing list, though I suspected it had been on an earlier night.

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 260x appears fairly bright, large, slightly 
elongated, ~3.0'x2.5', weak concentration except for a small elongated core or bar (this is a face-
on barred spiral).  Overall the surface brightness is fairly low, but fairly impressive due to its 
large size and central bar.  The galaxy is surrounded by a number of mag 13 stars.  A mag 8.9 
star (HD 85642) lies 5' WNW.

Discovered by WH (II 903) in the problematic sweep of 2 April 1802 of 15 northern galaxies and 
the NGC position is incorrect.  The precise position from Greenwich plates (MN 71, 509, 1911) 
matches II 905 = N3061 = U05319 = M+13-07-040.  The NGC designation is listed as uncertain 
in MCG (+13-07-040).

The NGC position for N3061 is from JH (h653) but the notes of the MN article mention "nothing 
shown on the photograph" [for h653] and repeated in Dreyer's 1912 Correction list in MNRAS.  
JH's own description for h653 reads "very doubtful, moon and haze".

SW; the closest is a mag 12 star 4.8' WSW and the farther two forms a nice wide double 
(12.4/13.3 at 35").  There is an impression of faint haze off the SE end of galaxy which creates a 
sense of elongation.  On the POSS, this is a double system - the "faint haze" off the SE end is 
actually an edge-on contact system MCG +04-24-010 = N3088B.

position 10 06 47.9 +14 18 51.  The galaxy identified as N3119 in MCG (+03-26-027) is N3121 
= U05450 and Corwin feels it is more likely that N3119 is a duplicate of N3121 due to the better 
positional match.  But CGCG 093-045 was visible in my scope so it should have visible to Marth

Dreyer's correction in his Scientific Papers of WH, N3122 is a perfect match for Stephan's

Identification from HC (Todd discovery).

Discovered by Todd (21).  Based on Todd's sketch Corwin identified NGC 3134 = MCG +02-
26-031 = CGCG 064-088 at 10 12 29.3 +12 22 38 (2000).  This galaxy is about 3 tmin E of 
Todd's very rough RA and was not found by Bigourdan (probably because of the discrepancy in 
position). Todd measured a "bright" star 28.3s following and there is a mag 12 GSC star at his 
exact separation clinching the identification.  DSS shows this galaxy to be edge-on SW-NE.

magnitude star was involved, and there is a very faint star at the NE edge.

Discovered by JH (h3234).  Listed as Type 0 in the RNGC so not listed in DSFG or plotted on

David Frew (Sky & Space, Apr-May 1998): A small galaxy, NGC 3149, is found 30' north and a 
little east of NGC 3195.  It is a distant spiral no more than 1' across with a brighter core, faintly 
visible through 20 cm in good conditions.  The magnitude is about 12.5 and little more seems to 
be known about it.  John Herschel discovered it on the same night as NGC 3195, and he noted a 
15th magnitude star within, but off centre.

Andrew James: NGC 3149 is a galaxy that lies near the same field of NGC 3195. It can see in 
the same field if the planetary is placed at the bottom SE edge of the eyepiece, with the galaxy 
being near the edge in the NW. At magnitude 13.1 it is clearly visible in a 20cm., subtending a 
circular size some 2'x1.9' min.arc. I could see no detail in the faint 'smudge', in what I describe 
as another typically unexciting galaxy. This object is not listed in Sky Catalogue 2000.0 or Sky 
Atlas 2000.0. Both the NGC and RNGC description is F,S,LE, VLBM,*15INV 'Faint, small, 
little extended, very little brighter in middle, 15 stars involved.'

Andrew Murrell (20"): This galaxy appears larger than shown on the map. It is about 5' in 
diameter, appearing as a face-on spiral. There is a noticable brightening towards the nucleus, 
while the rest of the galaxy has a fairly even surface brightness. A 15th mag star lies on the 
northern edge of the nucleus.

d'Arrest's position for N3183 matches U05582 = M+12-10-028.  This galaxy was first observed

in the positions.  The corrected position from Greenwich plates show that I 283 = N3218 = 
N3183.  Based on historical precedence N3218 should be the primary designation but modern 
catalogues identify this galaxy as N3183.

17.5" (3/25/00): very faint, extremely small, round, ~15" diameter (probably viewed core only), 
faint stellar nucleus.  Located 1.2' SE of a mag 12.5 star.  This galaxy is identified as N3186 in 
the RNGC and PGC but the identification is uncertain due to a poor position from Albert Marth.

Discovered by Marth.  His position is 10 17 18 +07 03 (2000). This position is 20 tsec W and 5' 
N of M+01-26-032 = CGCG 036-085 (the galaxy identified as N3186 in RNGC and PGC).  But 
Corwin suggests that N3186 may be the northeastern component of CGCG 36-074.  This galaxy 
is 1.5 tmin preceding and 6' S of Marth's position.

In my observation of the field, I picked up IC 602 = UGC 05561 (double system with IC 601) 
which is located exactly 1.0 tmin E of Marth's position and is a brighter galaxy than (R)N3186.  
Because this galaxy is only off in RA (by a single tmin) it seems a better choice than the RNGC 
candidate.  Javelle placed this galaxy correctly and it is identified as IC 602 in all modern 
catalogues.  See NGCBUGS for more on the story.

24" (4/4/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 350x, appeared fairly bright, moderately 
large, slightly elongated SSW-NNE, ~40"x35".  The planetary is clearly annular at this 
magnification with the rim brightest along the east and west sides, giving a bipolar appearance.  
The southern end of the rim dims, making the rim appear U-shaped, open to the south (though 
weaker on the north end).  The central hole is irregularly shaped with careful viewing.  Two mag 
12 stars to the west at 45" and 1.6' are collinear with the planetary and a brighter mag 11.5 lies 2' 
SE.  The surrounding field is lacking in bright stars but rich in faint stars.  N3149 lies 30' NNW.

18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is an interesting planetary at 171x with a 
UHC filter or at 228x.  It appears moderately bright and large, ~40"x35", slightly elongated ~N-
S.  This disc has a noticeably irregular surface brightness with a slightly brighter knot on the 
following side and a hint of annularity.  Good response to UHC and OIII filters.  Located in 
southern Chamaeleon between Zeta and Delta Chamaeleontis.

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x and UHC filter this Wolf-Rayet bubble 
appeared as an amazing 180° crescent, open on the east side and forming a thick "C" shape.  The 
rim of the bubble is widest on the western portion, although it is slightly brighter on the SW side.  
The main portion of the crescent spans ~13' from the N to S end and ~3.5' thick in the middle, 
though fainter nebulosity spreads out to the SE. Embedded near the S end is a double star ( 
h4302 = 10.4/11.6 at 23").  The surface brightness is fairly high overall, though irregular with 
slightly brighter patches, knots and streaks.  Along the outer western edge a faint 5' linear streak 
or filament is superimposed running SSW-NNE, though it separates or resolves from the 
Crescent at its N and S ends.  The illuminating mag 10.6 Wolf-Rayet star (WR 18 = HD 89358) 
is located about 4' E of the center of the "C".  This W-R bubble is situated four degrees NW of 
the Eta Carina nebula in a rich Milky Way star field.

13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x and UHC filter, this HII region appears as a remarkable, 
huge crescent, roughly 11'x7' (the main region extends nearly 1/3 of the 39' field).  Opens up 
towards the east in a huge "C" shape.  The SW portion of the crescent is brightest, although the 
overall surface brightness is irregular with a mottled or curdled appearance.  A few stars are 
superimposed even with the filter with the brightest stars at the SW end.  Fainter nebulosity 
sprouts out of the SW end, increasing the total size by several arcminutes.  Surprisingly, N3199 
was visible in the 9x50 finder by blinking with the OIII filter as an elongated bar of nebulosity!

18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is an amazing HII region with a 20mm 
Nagler and UHC filter at 103x.  It appears as a fairly bright, thick crescent opening towards the 
east, roughly 10'x6'!  The surface brightness was quite irregular with a UHC filter and the 
nebulosity was noticeably brighter on the south end where a couple of brighter stars are 
embedded.  Off the bright portion of the south end, much lower surface brightness haze extends 
the curve further SE for several arcmin and spreads out somewhat increasing the length to  ~15'.  
The main mass has a curdled, mottled appearance and dark lanes appear to intrude into the 
nebulosity.  The illuminating star HD 89358 is a Wolf-Rayet star (WR 18) and this nebulosity is 
reminiscent of the Crescent Nebula in Cygnus (it could be dubbed the "Southern Crescent").

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x, this beautiful, loose globular was well 
resolved with ~200 mag 12 to 16 stars visible within a 10' region.  An unusual feature is the large 
number of brighter cluster stars that appear to be superimposed right on top of a fainter layer of 
stars in the central core.  The core seems displaced displaced towards the north side as if part of 
the northern half of the cluster was obscured and flattened.  This apparent affect may also be due 
to a larger number of brighter resolved stars superimposed on the northern half of the core.  A 
number of stars in the outer halo are in strings and chains and the outline is irregular.

18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): beautifully resolved globular at 171x and 228x.  
The cluster is fairly large, ~8'-10' diameter with more careful viewing.  Roughly 150 stars are 
resolved, though the number grows with magnification and averted vision.  A fairly dense layer 
of brighter mag 11.5-12 stars are resolved right over the bright core.  The halo, which has a large 
number of mag 13 stars, has a scraggly, irregular edge and seems elongated - possibly partially 
obscured by dust.  This concentration class X cluster is 7th in ranking of brightest stars and 10th 
in horizontal-branch mag stars (high resolution).

13" (2/23/85): this fairly bright globular cluster appears fairly large and mottled.  But only a few 
stars are resolved due to observation at very low elevation in sky (-46° declination).

Discovered by JH (h706). Not found by Lord Rosse in six observations and not found by 
Reinmuth or Carlson (repeated in RNGC).  As his description is "pB" this probably is a duplicate 
observation with a bad position although h mentions it could be a comet in GC.  In the NGC 
notes, Dreyer states that N3234 is probably identical to N3235 with a 1 degree error in 
declination.  In the IC 1 notes, though, Dreyer states that ? N3235 as both seen by Denning.  See 
NGCBUGS for further discussion.

Discovered by WH (III 912).  In Scientific Papers, Dreyer states "it precedes III 913 (N3408) 
16.0 tmin, 5' N, so it is no doubt identical to either III 917 or III 918 [N3286 or N3288] which 
were observed the following night without any mention of III 912. Reinmuth describes N3284 as 
a "*14 npp 1.5' of NGC 3288; no neb seen; nothing sp of NGC 3288."  This conclusion is 
repeated in Carlson and RNGC.  Corwin states the GC/NGC position of N3284 is 10 tsec too 
small and that N3284 is likely a duplicate observation of N3286.  See NGCBUGS.

and 13' N of mag 4.9 HD 92036.  HCG 48 lies 9' NE.  This member of AGC 1060 (Hydra I) has 
a disputed identification due to a poor discovery position.

Discovered by E.P. Austin (Annals of Harvard Observatory, Vol 13, #207) within the galaxy 
cluster Abell 1060 and placed at 10 34 55 -27 30 (1950).  No galaxy exists at this position within 
the cluster although RNGC identifies N3315 as E501-047, located at 10 34.9 -27 13 (1950).

While this identication is possible, Austin described a "star 1' NW" which does not apply to this 
galaxy.  There is a very bright 5th magnitude star 3' N which would have warranted special 
mention as it would have interfered with the observation.  However, 30' N of Austin's position is 
ESO 501-G48 = MCG -04-25-042 at 10 37 19.2 -27 11 30 (2000) which has a 10th magnitude 
star 1' NW.  Based on Austin's visual description and a probable digit error in declination, this 
identification appears more likely and is the one used in ESO-Uppsala and RC3.  Corwin 
originally listed this number as a duplicate of N3314 (which Austin observed the same night) but 
now feels it was more likely a 30' error in dec by Austin.  (R)N3315 = E501-047 is located 17' S 
of the galaxy listed here.

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): I only took a quick look at the "Gabriela 
Mistral" Nebula nebula at 200x and a UHC filter, but the brightest portion appeared like a 
cartoon drawing of a whale with a huge, very bright bulbous "head" forming the northern end of 
the nebula.  The brightest portion is perhaps 15'x6' in size, but quite an extensive amount of 
fainter nebulosity spreads out the E and SE of the main body, significantly increasing the size to 
~15'x11', elongated N-S.  Some faint nebulosity also spreads to the west of the main portion.  At 
the south end is mag 5.5 HD 92207.

13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): striking HII region and cluster 30' SE of N3293 and 90' NW of the 
center of the Eta Carina nebula! (this is an outlying piece of the Eta Carina complex)  At 105x 
and UHC filter this huge, elongated, irregular nebula is quite bright, perhaps 15'x6' in size and 
tapers towards the south end where mag 5.5 HD 92207 is embedded.  The nebula widens to a 
well-defined bulbous mass on the north end.  Faint nebulosity hooks off the north end and 
spreads to the east and northeast.  This HII region is ionized by mag 8 HD 92206 = h4338 (an 
8.2/9.2 pair at 5") situated near the center of the nebula.  Unfiltered, a scattered group of stars is 
superimposed but this just appears to be a random star grouping in the Carina section of the 
Milky Way.

Discovered by WH (III 5).  Described as "The faintest and smallest nebula imaginable.  I viewed 
it a long while and with a higher power than the sweeper.  Having no person at the clock, I went 
in to write down the time and found it impossible to recover the nebula.  It appeared like a vS 
nebulous star, and is probably of the cometic sort; there was another vS star south-following (I 
think, or rather, am pretty sure), and it preceded a pB * [the nebula is south-preceding of a star 
by a diagram, about 6 arcmin][JLED].  It should have been secured before I went into the light.  
Its place must be about 2 1/2 deg following rho Leonis and about 10 arcmin more north than that 
star.''  Not seen by Spitaler or Bigourdan and identified as a mag 15 star by Reinmuth and a star 
by Carlson.  Corwin states that Herschel's description of the field matches N3332 (see 
NGCBUGS) although the RA is off by over 2 tmin of RA and 15' in dec.

NGC 3371 was discovered by JH (h751) and described as "F, R. The second of 3 in a triangle."  
Peters claimed an observation but this object was not recovered by Rosse, Schultz, Bigourdan or 
Reinmuth.  Just 1' W of Peter's position is a mag 15.1 star at 10 46 57.5 +13 47 31 (J2000) and 1' 
S is a mag 14 star at 10 47 01.3 +13 46 29 (possibly elongated on the DSS image?).  Carlson 
identifed N3771 with a star based on Mount Wilson photographs.  But, in NGCBUGS, Corwin 
argues that the trio Herschel is referring to is N3379, N3384 (h751 = N3371) and N3389 (h753 = 
N3373), as this trio matches the position angles given in the observation of the first of the group.

NGC 3372 = ESO 128-EN013 = Gum 33 = RCW 53 = Eta Carina Nebula = Keyhole Nebula
10 45 09 -59 52.0
Size 120x120

13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): I spent quite a bit of time on the Eta Carina complex, particularly 
examining the remarkable Homunculus Nebula. This is easily the largest bright emission nebula 
in the sky and a very prominent naked-eye object within the amazingly rich Carina Milky Way.  
Bright islands of billowing nebulosity are separated by dark lanes or rifts and the entire complex 
overfilled the 105x field at the eyepiece.

The surface brightness of the various sections is fairly uniform and pretty high, though it lowers 
in the outskirts.  No section is comparable in intensity to the central heart of the Orion Nebula, 
but the large wedge that contains Eta Car is quite prominent.  A UHC filter enhances the 
nebulosity without significantly dimming the stars.  Just west of Eta (within the central wedge) is 
the fairly prominent, dark "Keyhole Nebula" that extends ~5' length and elongated N-S (not as 
contrasty as when John Herschel named it in the 1830's).  Eta Carina's orange color and the small 
bipolar blowouts are quite stunning at high power.  Involved with the nebulosity are several 
clusters, the most prominent being Tr 16 just south of Eta Car.

20" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): Using a 20 Nagler (127x) and UHC filter, the 
field of Eta Carina was a breathtaking sight.  The outer wings and streamers extended well 
outside the 39' field.  The turbulent nebulosity had a curdled, electric appearance with a strong 3-
dimensional effect as brighter streaks, wings, fainter masses and dark lanes were mixed together 
throughout the field.

12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): My first views of the Eta Carina nebula through Les' 12.5" and 
Gary's 20" were truly breathtaking and dwarfed the Orion Nebula in size and detail.  The nebula 
is broken into 4 or 5 main separate masses of varying sizes, shapes and surface brightness by 
three wide, dark obscuring dust lanes.  The mottled nebulosity has an amazing 3-dimensional 
curdled appearance and is riddled with dark bays and rifts.  Outer loops and brighter streaks 
complete an amazing vista. 

The brightest section forms a triangular wedge isolated by prominent dark lane which cuts at a 
striking right angle.  This wedge contains the centerpiece Eta Carina which has an amazing 
orange color.  Extending from Eta are the two small lobes (one is brighter), referred to as the 
"Homunculus nebula" and appearing as an explosive event from the early 19th century in a HST 
image.  Just preceding Eta is an elongated N-S, curving dark lane nicknamed the "Keyhole 
Nebula" by John Herschel as well as the open cluster Tr 16 just south of Eta.

The best overall view of the nebula was in the 20" at 80x (32 mm) using a UHC filter.  Even at 
this low power, the Eta Carina nebula still overfilled the field with contrasty dark lanes and 
amazingly structured islands of nebulosity.  I stared into the eyepiece quietly, somewhat stunned 
by its beauty.  With this aperture at 282x, the 12"x8" bipolar Homunculus nebula was an 
astounding sight.  The orange central star appeared quasi-stellar with the unequal blowouts fairly 
prominent.  They had an eerie, translucent appearance with the western lobe somewhat smaller, 
fainter and more pinched with the eastern lobe more circular.  A possible dark lane is near the 
center and punctures the lobes.  See involved clusters Tr 14, Tr 16.

Discovered by JH (h753) and described as "F, R, the last of 3 in a triangle."  Not found by 
Bigourdan, Peters, Rosse, Schultz (who questioned whether this object and N3371 exists) or 
Reinmuth!  Identified by Carlson as a star based on a Mount Wilson photograph. A mag 14.7 
GSC star is near JH's position but  Corwin feels there was a confusion on the first object in this 
"trio" which is actually N3379 and using the given position angles with respect to this galaxy, 
then N3373 = N3389 and N3371 = N3384.

See observation of N3428.  Identification uncertain.

Discovered by Common.  His position is just 3 tsec E and 1' S of N3428 (from Marth) and is a 
likely duplicate observation. RNGC identifies N3429 with the anonymous galaxy (PGC 32510) 
at 10 50 57.5 +09 15 53 which is 0.6 tmin W of Common's place (actually not a large error for 
Common).  Alister Ling feels the RNGC identification is unlikely and is this entry is probably a 
duplicate of N3428.  Corwin concurs (see NGCBUGS).

See observing notes for N3457.

Dreyer attributed the discovery to Lord Rosse and Swift (I) but there is no object at Swift's 
position and his desciption "pB, R, no star near" appears to describe N3457.  On 27 Mar 1854, 
Rosse observed "A S neb n of a B one, dist about 5'-6'." (under the listing for N3457) and this 
pair was reobserved on 4 Apr 1878.  This clearly refers to N3460 = U06030 and N3461.  Later, 
on 22 Mar 1878, Rosse mentions finding an "eS cl , with a *12 in Pos 175 deg, dist 305 arcsec".  
It's most likely that this observation is not related to the galaxy but may refer to the 3 faint stars + 
galaxy 4.5' following N3457 (IC 656?).  RNGC has a typo and equates N3557 = N3460. See 
NGCBUGS for further discussion.

This galaxy is a rediscovery by JH (h795) of III 967 = U06056 = M+13-08-048 = Z351-050. JH's

(III 967) along with III 968 (both identified as N3500 in NGC) during the problematic northern 
sweep of 15 galaxies on 2 Apr 1801.  The precise position from Greenwich plates for III 967 in

Discovered by WH (III 968) along with III 967 = N3465 during the northern sweep of 2 Apr

of WH's catalogues, Dreyer gives a corrected position for III 968 (from MN, 71, 509, 1911) 
which is identical to U06090 = MCG +13-08-052 = CGCG 351-052.  This galaxy is not 
identified as N3500 in any of these catalogues including RC3.  CGCG and UGC list N3500 as a

Leavenworth's rough position (I) matches M-02-28-041 in RA but is 50' too far N.  This is the 
identification used in RNGC, but the Leander-McCormick positions are generally fairly accurate 
in declination but off several tmin in RA.  Corwin feels a more like identification is N3502 = 
N3479.  Both of these entries are from volume 1 of the Leander-McCormick catalogue 
(Leavenworth and Stone) and differ only in RA by 4 tmin.

three additional stars in a string. Several additional faint stars spiral out from the grouping.  The 
haze that surrounds these 5 stars is ~3' in diameter.  There was little or no contrast gain using a 
UHC filter, so the nebulosity must not have a significant emission component.  Situated in a rich

noticeably mottled at first glance and a dust lane runs NNW-SSE along the west side of the core.  
There is a strong impression of spiral structure with an arm attached on the east side that extends 
to the north and appears to curve towards the west in the outer halo.  The halo appears more 
extensive or slightly brighter on the northern end.  A more difficult arm appears to sweep to the 
south on the west side of the core.

17.5" (1/19/91): very bright, very large, elongated 5'x2' NNW-SSE.  This is an impressive 
galaxy!  Contains a well-defined small bright oval core NNW-SSE and a stellar nucleus.  
Appears mottled near the core and on the west side.  Along the west side is a dust lane evident as 
a sharp light cut-off.  The west side is somewhat fainter due to dust but extends beyond the dust 
lane.

8": fairly bright, fairly large, elongated, bright core.  Located 33' E of a mag 6 star.

a stellar nucleus.  Surrounding the core is a fairly large ill-defined halo elongated 3:2 SW-NE, 
~2.5'x1.5' with a low surface brightness.  A couple of faint stars are superimposed on the south

JH's position (h3316) is just 6 tsec far W of ESO 570-006 = MCG -03-28-037.  This galaxy is 
identified as N3497 in the RC3 which is the NGC number for William Herschel's earlier 
observation (III 824) though with a poor position.  In Scientific Papers of WH, Dreyer notes that 
WH's position for III 824 = N3497 had an error of 6 tmin in RA and is identical to h3316 = 
N3528.  Swift's duplicate observation for IC 2624 placed this galaxy 5' too far S although it was 
correctly described as the N of two.  Finally, Stone's duplicate observation (N3525) also refers to 
this galaxy!  So there is a total of 4 NGC/IC equivalences with this single galaxy.

11 05 48 -58 46.2
V = 3.0;  Size 55

13.1" (2/18/04 - Costa Rica): this amazing naked-eye cluster packs several hundred stars, filling 
the 20 Nagler field (74x and 65' field of view) with wall-to-wall stars in a 55'x35' region!  The 
central region is condensed and quite rich with several dense knots consisting of pairs, triples, 
chains, etc.  The brighter stars are extended ~E-W, although there is no well-defined edge to this 
huge cluster.  There is a huge "U" shaped chain of stars around the periphery including a bright 
star on the SE end. A neat equal mag equilateral triangle of stars stood out within the maze of 
stars.  The cluster is quite prominent naked-eye as a 45' cloud just 3° ENE of Eta Carina in the 
NE corner of the rich Carina starcloud.  It is densely packed with dozens of resolved stars in the 
9x50 finder.  Mag 3.9 V382 Carinae is off the SE side.

18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): This spectacular naked-eye and binocular cluster 
(3° ENE of Eta Carina) and fills the entire 51' field of the 27 Panoptic (76x) with several hundred 
stars mag 7 and fainter.  It is unusually elongated ~E-W, perhaps 55'x30' and widening on the 
following side.  The stars are irregularly distributed with many in pairs, small groups, chains and 
loops.  A group of about a dozen stars form a perfect "S" asterism.  Interestingly, there is a lack 
of dense knots although the entire central region is rich.  Many of the stars appear to have a blue 
or yellowish tint.  This is one of the top open clusters in the sky although it is probably best in a 
wider field view.

Discovered by Swift (I) as the NE of a pair with N3551.  His RA is off by exactly 1.0 tmin from 
U06203 = M+04-26-035.  This galaxy is identified as N3555 in RNGC and PGC but not UGC, 
MCG or CGCG.  As N3551 (placed close SW by Swift) is 1.5' SW from this object, the 
identification appears OK.  See NGCBUGS for an alternate interpretation of the identifications.

Discovered by JH (h834).  JH listed h834 = III 79 = N3560 in his 1833 Slough Catalogue 
although probably due to a digit error his declination was 50' too small.  As JH listed h834 
separately in GC (apparently overlooking his previous equivalence), Dreyer listed h834 = N3560 
separately in the NGC. Corwin (see e-mail 8/10/95) identifies N3560 = h834 = III 79 = N3559 as 
JH originally stated. Reinmuth states "in Dreyer's place *16."  Also listed as a star by Carlson.

18" (3/17/07): very faint, very small, slightly elongated, 20"x15".  Located 13' WNW a mag 8.3 
HD 96800.  The identification of this galaxy with N3565 is not certain and the number (along 
with N3566) may apply to IC 2623 and a star just south.  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.

Ormond Stone recorded a very faint pair of nebulae which he gave the same rough position 11 
08± -19 46 (1950) in list I.  Dreyer included these two objects as N3565 and N3566.  ESO-
Uppsala and RC3 both identify N3565 = N3566 = E570-IG008, an interacting double galaxy 
located at 11 05 19.7 -19 45 05.3 (1950), essentially two tmin W of Stone's position (typical 
error in the first discovery list).  On the POSS, the images of these two small galaxies are merged 
and difficult to individually distinguish.  So, it's possible that Stone observed this galaxy and a 
nearby faint star for his second object.

As Sulentic could not find any galaxy at Stone's original position on the POSS, he classified 
N3565 and N3566 as nonexistent in the RNGC.  Assuming N3565 = N3566 = E570-IG8 with a 
two minute error in RA, the RNGC position for these objects should be changed to 11 06.6 -19 
53 (1975).  Listed as a single entry in ESGC and in ESO, RC3, ESGC and PGC.  As an 
alternative, Corwin suggests that N3565 and 3566 may apply to IC 2623 and a star close S, 
though this requires a 4 tmin error in RA  See RNGC Corrections #6 and NGCBUGS.

18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): first of six sections in a small, but very 
interesting nebulous complex consisting of N3576, N3579, N3581, N3582, N3584 and N3586 - 
all situated in the same low power field with N3603!  N3576 is a somewhat isolated patch on the 
SW side about 5' from the main sections.  At 128x and a UHC filter it appeared as a faint, 
circular hazy patch of low surface brightness with a mag 12.5 star at the west side and ~1.5' in 
diameter.  N3579 is a small, fan or wedge-shaped section located just to the west of larger 
N3584.  It appears 2' in size with a 12th magnitude star at the south tip and spreading to the north 
and west from this star.  N3581 is the brightest section of this complex and has sharply defined 
borders running SW-NE and NW-SE, meeting at a right angle about 1' WNW of mag 9.2 SAO 
251313. The overall size is ~2'x1.5' with an irregular surface brightness.  It is just disconnected 
from N3582, which is close NE.  N3582 is another fan-shaped section which wraps around a 
mag 10.6 star.  It has a well-defined edge running SW to NE with the northern border running E-
W. The brighter star is embedded roughly in the center and several mag 13 stars are near the 
border.  The diameter is ~2' (similar in size to N3581 just SW).  N3584 is the furthest NE and the 
largest section of nebulosity.  It appears as a looping arc about 3.5'x1', bowed out towards the 
east and extending mostly N-S and narrowing at the north end.  A few mag 12 stars are off the 
edges.  N3579 appears as nearly a continuation of this loop towards the west.  Finally, N3586, 
the last in the complex, is situated ~4' SE of the center of the group of nebulae.  It appears as a 
faint, elongated steak of 2' length oriented N-S with an 11th magnitude star about 40" NE of the 
north tip.  The entire group was roughly sketched and easily matched up with the DSS later.  
N3603 lies ~25' E.

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia):  this distant (20,000 light years) superluminous 
HII region and cluster was mesmerizing at 200x using a UHC filter.  The nebulosity is generally 
elongated E-W, ~5'x3', but with bays and extensions and dark lanes.  The surface brightness is 
highest to the south of the embedded cluster with a dark lane slashing through the nebulosity just 
west of the bright core.  At 350x, 15-20 stars were resolved in the glow, though the tiny, brilliant 
"core" cluster was only mottled and barely resolved into a few stars.

13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x a bright irregular nebula surrounds a mag 9 "star".  At 
200x, a half-dozen very faint stars are packed very close to the central star.  This very compact 
knot is actually a distant, very dense, young cluster of extremely luminous stars!  Adding a UHC 
filter, the nebulosity is irregular at 105x, extending mostly south of the star and fading out into 
two or three sections that are possibly divided by a dark lane.  The brightest section is to the 
southwest of the central star.

18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 228x this distant but superluminous HII 
region is a fascinating clump of stars of and nebulosity surrounding a bright 9th magnitude knot.  
The bright central region was extremely dense and contained 10-12 stars crammed into 2', yet it 
seemed only partially resolved at the very center into a couple of stars.  At 128x and UHC filter, 
the surrounding "haze" is clearly gaseous in nature with the brightest portion offset to the SW 
side from the core with a roughly broad fan with a total size of approximately 5'x3'.  A dark lane 
appears to cut through the nebulosity towards the core and there is a strong impression that the 
field is riddled with dust lanes and patches.  This is a well-studied highly reddened, luminous 
cluster (~20,000 light years) and HII region with similarities to the Tarantula nebula in the LMC!

catalogue.

From the SGC: Small bright nucleus, bar(?) with dust, extremely faint arms form (R'): 2.3 x 1.2. 
Star superposed 0.4 south-preceding. Partially obscured by galactic diffuse nebula.

From David Frew: To the north and west of  IC 2631 the obscuration thins out, revealing the 
distant star-fields beyond - look for the remote spiral galaxy NGC 3620 some 20' NW of IC 
2631.  The galaxy appears as a faint spindle about 1´ long, elongated in pa 90°, with a slightly 
brighter core; 20 cm should show it and the star on its south edge in good conditions.

Discovered by WH (II 32) and placed 6.5 tmin W and 7' N of 84 (Tau) Leo.  This position is 1 
min 10 sec following h861 = N3630.  The identification of II 32 is discussed in detail by 
Malcolm Thomson in WSQJ #73,  Alister Ling in WSQJ #87 and Harold Corwin in NGCBUGS. 
They conclude that II 32 is a duplicate observation of N3630, although in the NGC notes, Dreyer 
states "N3645 ? N3630".  RNGC and CGCG misidentify N3645 as CGCG 39-143 (15.5z)

Three mag 14 stars are within 2'.  Located 4.6' SSE of a mag 10 star. The NGC identification is 
very uncertain and may apply to MCG -01-29-012.

Discovered by WH (III 112) on the same night by as N3915 (sweep 205, 24 April 1784), neither 
of which match galaxies in the sky.  Dreyer gives an approximate position in NGC due to 
uncertainty with his reference star.  See Notes section of NGC.  William mentions a "vB star 
near" but there is no bright star near M-01-29-021 which RNGC identifies as N3679.  
Furthermore, the NGC position is 16' S of M-01-29-021 (MCG does not make the NGC 
identification) and WH's original offset is 20' S of this galaxy, so this identification seems 
unlikely.  In the IC I notes, the position is revised by Spitaler who found nothing at the NGC or 
Auwer's position.  See Corwin's extensive discussion in NGCBUGS where he suggests that 
N3679 might be M-01-29-012 which is 2.4' S of of mag 7.9 SAO 138156.

This unusual system appears moderately bright, fairly small, elongated E-W.  The appearance is 
confusing with two very small "knots" in a common halo elongated E-W (20" between centers).  
On the west side is a fairly bright virtually stellar "knot" which is probably the nucleus of the 
brighter member N3690.  There is a small fainter unconcentrated extension on the following end 
and the two components are not individually resolved.  With averted vision an extremely faint 
spot (this may be the "real" IC 694) is intermittently visible about 1' NW.

17.5" (3/19/88): fairly bright, moderately large, elongated ~E-W, irregular, mottled appearance.  
A mag 14 star is superimposed on the west side and an extremely faint mag 15.5 star or knot is 
involved.  This is a disrupted interacting system which includes IC 694.

Discovered by WH (I 247).  See the short article on identifications by Murray Cragin in April 
1993 Deep-Sky Observer (Webb Society).  N3690 and IC 694 are part of an interacting system 
oriented E-W without well-defined centers.  IC 694 appears to apply to an extremely faint 16th 
mag companion 1.1' NW of the N3690 system within the outer halo.  See visual observation of 
IC 694.

17.5" (4/18/98): faint, fairly small, elongated 3:2 ~NNW-SSE, 1.0'x0.7'.  Weak even 
concentration to a slightly brighter core and occasional stellar nucleus with direct vision at 280x.  
A mag 14 star lies 1.7' SE.  In a trio with N3694 11' SSW and N3700 5.7' SE.

Discovered by Ball at Birr Castle on 31 Mar 1867 in the observation of N3694.  Described as "3 
F Neb forming a triangle certainly seen here and one or more susp in the neighborhood.  There 
being no great difference in brightness, it is not easy to see which is h899.  The 2 nf ones, pos 
310°, dist 339" [5564 and 5566]."  The relative position for the latter two exactly match N3695 = 
GC 5564 = U6490 and N3700 = GC 5566 = U6494.

But on 18 Mar 1876 Dreyer reobserved N3694 and stated "nnp is a pS, eeF neb [=5564] in PA 
357.2°, Dist 256.7"."  This was the position Dreyer used in NGC for N3695, although it 
corresponds with mag 14.8 GSC star at 11 28 53.1 +35 29 00 (2000).  In the same observation, 
Dreyer notes "about 15' n and a few minutes f is another eF, vS neb [5565] with an ef* 2' sf."  
Apparently he felt this object was not observed on 31 Mar 1867 so it was given a separate 
designation, GC 5565 = N3698, but this rough description appears to describe U6490 = N3695 
which has a mag 14.4 GSC star 1.7' SE.  So, it seems likely that N3698 is a duplicate observation 
of N3695.  Reinmuth identifies U6490 as N3698 and misidentifies N3695 with the faint star 4.1' 
N of N3694 given by Dreyer.

V = 11.0;  Size 71"

24" (4/5/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this showpiece planetary appeared very bright, 
fairly large, ~70" in diameter and gave an excellent contrast response to the UHC filter at 200x.  
The planetary is bisected by a prominent, broad dark rift that slashes through the planetary from 
WSW to ENE (like Centaurus A!).  The northern lobe is the more prominent: both larger and 
brighter.  The shape of this lobe is semicircular with a round, outer periphery but with a fairly 
straight edge SW-NE in the interior due to the dark rift.  The center of the dust lane is south of 
the geometric center of the planetary, giving an asymmetric distribution to the lobes.  The rift 
itself is widest at the ENE end and tapers down towards the WSW end.  Superb view at 350x as 
the extra magnification increases the contrast and confirms that the south lobe is fully detached 
by the dust land at the WSW end.  The compact planetary He 2-67 lies in the same field 11' SE.

13.1" (2/17/04 - Costa Rica): at 100x, this planetary appeared moderately bright and large, ~60"-
65" in size.  There was a good contrast gain with a UHC filter at 105x and 166x and it appeared 
brightest on the north side of the planetary.  A dark rift running WSW-ENE appears to nearly 
detach the smaller and fainter southern section.

18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 128x this interesting planetary is moderately 
bright, fairly large, ~70" in diameter with some faint stars superimposed.  With the UHC filter 
the appearance is very unusual with a dark rift bisecting it in a WSW-ENE orientation just below 
the geometric center.  At 228x, the northern "hemisphere" is both larger and brighter with an 
irregular surface brightness.  A mag 13 star is ~1' NW.  This is a fascinating planetary set in a 
beautiful Centaurus star field with an appearance similar to faint HII region or a small version of 
Cen A!

17.5" (3/29/85): extremely faint and small, round.  Picked up 2.6' E of N3704.  Incorrectly listed 
as nonexistent in the RNGC.

N3704 and N3707 are attributed to both Common and Tempel in the NGC.  Common's 
description in Copernicus, Vol 1 reads "2, F, R, on the parallel, star symmetrically placed 
between."  Howe could only find 1 object on 4 nights.

13' due S of Common's single position (obtained from the setting circles) is a very faint pair of 
galaxies observed in my 17.5".  The first of these galaxies is N3704 = M-02-29-037 at 11 30 04.6 
-11 32 48 (2000) which has a mag 15 star 42" E.  N3704 also has an extremely faint and compact 
companion 1.7' E with the mag 15 star between the galaxies as in Common's description, so it is 
a reasonable match for N3707 at 11 30 11.6 -11 32 37.  For some reason, the RNGC ignores the 
second fainter galaxy of the pair and lists N3707 as nonexistent.

Unfortunately, the NGC summary descriptions (from Tempel?) have some errors.  The listing for 
N3704 mentions a mag 9-10 2' SSE of N3704, although the bright star is actually 2.6' WNW.   
Additionally, the description for N3707 mentions a "*15 (neb?) 2s following", which actually 
describes the mag 15 star 2.8 tsec following N3704.  Nevertheless, Common's description is 
sufficient to identify this pair of galaxies.  See RNGC Corrections #4.

This number (from John Herschel) is probably just a duplicate observation of N3714 according 
to Harold Corwin.  In which case, the observation above refers to UGC 6506 which should not

Observed twice by JH (h905).  He mentioned the PD was rough as the object was observed well 
past meridian.  h905 was not found by Bigourdan and Reinmuth notes "only *14.5 nr Dreyer's

JH's position is off by <10' from this galaxy, so this identification seems plauisible.  I assume 
UGC 06506 is one of Reinmuth's "2 neb np".  UGC 06506 is not identified as NGC 3712 in

Discovered by Leavenworth (II) and described as the 2nd of two with N3722.  Corwin notes the 
identification N3724 = MCG -01-30-007 is quite uncertain due to imprecise coordinates from 
Leavenworth and several galaxies in the vicinity.  MCG -01-30-007 is NE of M-01-30-005 but 
the discovery position placed it SE. It is also possible that N3724 = MCG -01-30-008 close NE 
(3rd of 3 on line) although this galaxy was the faintest visually of the trio.  RNGC places N3724 
south of N3722, although the rectangular coordinates correctly place it north.  The New

follows.  Located 16' N of N3732 and 10' NNW of a string of three galaxies (including N3722

and MCG -01-30-008 ~6' SE and a very faint pair of anonymous galaxies 4.5' NE and 7.0' NE.  
The NGC identification is very uncertain as Leavenworth's position is a very poor match.

Discovered by Leavenworth (II) and possibly independently observed by Common (Dreyer 
mentions N3730 is one of Common's "a cluster of 3 similar ones 15' N [of N3732]).  
Leavenworth's position is 0.6 tmin E and 6' N of N3724 (in a group with N3722, all with 
uncertain identifications), although N3724 is described as a pair only with N3722.  Corwin notes 
this identification is uncertain and lists as a more plausible candidate in ESGC the double galaxy 
M-01-30-003/004 at 11 34 16.8 -09 34 34 which is 0.2 tmin W of N3724 and 5' N. The DSFG 
data appears to apply to this galaxy although the given position is closer to M-1-30-008.

Another possibility is that N3730 refers to one of the extremely faint galaxies in a trio which is 
NE of M-01-03-003.  Of this trio, the galaxy at 11 34 43.3 -09 31 59 is the brightest and is 
located 15 tsec E and 7.6' N of M-01-30-007 which is a good match with his delta Dec from 
N3724.  RNGC appears to identify N3730 as M-01-30-008.  This galaxy is 9 tsec E and 1' N of 
N3724.

Discovered by Leavenworth (II).  His position is 1.7 tmin W of M-01-30-018 although the

west but instead mag 13.5 GSC star 16 tsec W and Leavenworth's magnitudes are often listed 
much too bright.  Still, Corwin gives this identifcation as somewhat uncertain.  See NGCBUGS.

Discovered by WH (III 773). This is a duplicate observation of N3804 (II 830), corrected by 
Dreyer in his 1912 revision of WH's catalogues.  RNGC identifes N3794 with M+09-19-149 = 
CGCG 268-068 located 1 degree south of the NGC position!  See Catalogue Corrections by 
Malcolm Thomson and NGCBUGS.  I observed M+09-19-149 assuming it was N3804.  N3794 
is equated with N3804 in DSFG.

Discovered by JH (h956).  His position of 11 43 15.5 +26 29 52 (2000) is 3.7' S of M+05-28-
024/025 = CGCG 157-023 which is identified as N3830 in RNGC.  Herschel was uncertain of 
the observation; "cloudy, hardly discernable".  According to the Vatican General Catalogue, 
Bigourdan could not recover this object. Corwin suggests that this entry (observed only once by 
JH) is probably a duplicate of N3826 preceding by 43 tsec but with the same declination.  N3826 
was observed on three sweeps but N3830 was recorded on a different sweep.  See NGCBUGS.

Discovered by WH (III 35). The NGC position is 43 tsec  E and 2' N of M+02-30-023 = CGCG 
68-46 which is identified as N3848 in RNGC.  Several other objects discovered by Herschel on 
the same sweep are generally 1 tmin of RA too far W.  Not found by Bigourdan although Dreyer 
states in Scientific Papers "observed by Bigourdan, place correct."

MCG +02-30-023 = CGCG 68-46 is not identified as N3848 in MCG or CGCG.  Malcolm 
Thomson concurs that N3848 = MCG +02-30-023 =CGCG 68-46 is a reasonable match in 
position.  Alternatively, Corwin suggests that N3848 and N3852 may be duplicate observations 
of N3822 and N3825.  The RA separation is exactly 2.0 tmin between the corresponding objects 
(similar but not exact dec).  See NGCBUGS for discussion.

See observing notes for N3825.

Discovered by WH (III 36).  The NGC position is 0.7 tmin E of N3848 = III 35.  Since WH 
discovered both N3848 and N3852 on the same sweep ("Two on parallel 3 or 4' dist.  Both eF, 
vS.") they seem unlikely to be duplicate observations although both numbers were equated by 
Dreyer in his 1912 NGC Correction list (repeated by Reinmuth).

In Scientific Papers of WH, Dreyer notes that N3852 was not found by Bigourdan but that 
possibly there was a 1 tmin error in RA in reducing the position which happened on a number of 
objects observed in the same sweep!  Corwin suggests N3848 and N3852 may be duplicate 
observations of N3822 and N3825 which have the same declination and 3.2' separation but lie 
2.0 tmin W of H's position.  So, I have N3852 = N3825 listed here, although this identification is 
not certain.

4.5' ESE (not observed on 2/24/90).  The identifications are very uncertain in this group.

N3855 and N3856 were discovered by d'Arrest.  The declination is listed as uncertain in the 
NGC although Dreyer gave a more accurate position (from Spitaler) for N3855 at 11h 41.6m 
+33d 37' (1950) and N3856 at 11h 41.8 +33d 37' in the Notes and Corrections section of the IC 
1.  At this exact position on the POSS is a pair of galaxies that were later reentered into the IC 2 
as IC 2952 and IC 2953 (accurately placed by Javelle) with the following object (IC 2953) both 
larger and brighter.

UGC, MCG and CGCG identify these two galaxies with the IC designations since the IC 
identifications are certain and RNGC, MCG and CGCG identify N3855 = M+06-26-028 = 
CGCG 186-036, a very small galaxy located 5' SE of the close pair, while N3856 is listed as 
nonexistent in the RNGC. It seems very unlikely that this was the single galaxy seen by d'Arrest 
as IC 2953 (15.1z) in the same field is both larger and more prominent visually than M+06-26-
028 (15.6z) based on my 17.5" observation.

If we accept Spitaler's corrected positions in the IC 2 notes, then N3855 = IC 2952 and N3856 = 
IC 2953 and the RNGC, MCG and CGCG have misidentified both numbers with M+06-26-028 
= CGCG 186-036.  It is also possible that N3855 = IC 2953 and N3856 = M+06-26-028. 
Thomson favors these identifications and they are given here.  See RNGC Corrections #5.

Corwin feels since d'Arrest only gave a rough position for N3855 and just mentions the second 
galaxy in the description (offset) it is more likely that he picked up the brightest two galaxies in 
the vicinity - IC 2953 and N3847 about 9' to the north.  So, he proposes N3855 = IC 2953 and 
N3856 = N3847!

This galaxy was misclassified as a diffuse nebula in the RNGC and as a reflection nebula in the 
Sky Atlas 2000.0, probably because it is embedded in the Milky Way.

Misclassified as a diffuse nebula in the RNGC and as a reflection nebula in the Sky Atlas 2000.0, 
probably because it is embedded in the Milky Way.  This galaxy has a very low surface 
brightness on DSS!

From Mike Kerr: This is a fairly bright galaxy which is situated "in" the bright Centaurus Milky 
Way, near in the sky to the open cluster NGC 3960 and the bright Planetary Nebula NGC 3918.  
NGC 3882 is only 5.3 degrees from the Galactic plane. Most of the other galaxies in this area of 
sky are B magnitude >= 15,  possibly due to much higher foreground extinction.  The Schlegel et 
al (1998) extinction maps give extinction of AB = 1.671 and E(B-V) = 0.387 (that is, 1.284 
magn. of visual extinction.). NGC 3882 has a recently measured aperture photometry magnitude 
from LEDA, which is B magnitude 12.80 +/- 0.10.

From Andrew Jones: NGC 3882 (11462-5624) is the SB spiral galaxy, west by 1.8 degrees, and 
perhaps a little south of NGC 3960. This galaxy is just visible in a 30cm, but is difficult without 
averted vision. Measured at photographic magnitude 13.3, this galaxy appears slightly elongated, 
along PA 65°-245°. In apparent size it is stated as 2.3'x1.3' - close to the size seen in the 
telescope. In a 30cm. I could not discern any structure, although there is a hint of brighter core 
and some detail in the southern portions of the galaxy. (I have not seen this structure myself). 
The visual poorness of this galaxy is understandable as it is immersed within the Milky Way.

Dist 340.5"."  This placed the object southeast of N3888 instead of northeast and in compiling 
the NGC, Dreyer was swayed by the second observation and placed N3889 just 2 seconds of RA 
following N3888 and 5.6' south.  There is no object at the NGC position for N3889 but 3.7' 
northeast of N3888 is located the faint galaxy M+09-19-191 which was visible in my 17.5"

Discovered by WH (III 341).  His position matches U06803 = M+04-28-059 = CGCG 127-064 
but when John Herschel reobserved this field, he assumed this galaxy was a nova and the fainter 
galaxy 10' W was his father's III 341.  Furthermore, his RA was offset to the east and because of 
this confusion the identifications of N3911 and N3920 have been exchanged in CGCG and 
repeated in all modern catalogues.  The identifications given by Thomson (Catalogue 
Corrections and WSQJ 4/89) and Corwin (NGCBUGS) have the RA out of order but now agree

11 50 17.8 -57 10 56
V = 8.2;  Size 19"

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x the "Blue Planetary" has an even, 
extremely high surface brightness disc of 15" and a saturated, vivid blue color.  The edge is 
crisply defined and the disc has a uniform surface brightness.  At 350x, the planetary is oval or 
irregular, perhaps 18"x15".  There was no sign of the central star, though I didn't try higher 
powers.

18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 76x appears as a bright, beautiful blue 
cosmic egg floating in a rich star field, ~15" diameter.  Extremely high surface brightness and 
with a sharply defined edge to the uniformly lit disc.  At 228x, appears to be set in the middle of 
an absorption hole in the Milky Way as there are very few faint stars in a 4'-5' circular region 
surrounding the planetary.  Outside this hole, the Milky Way background is very evident and 
fairly bright.

13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica):  at 195x, this 8th magnitude planetary appears as a beautiful 10"-
12" blue disc with a very crisp edge.  No central star was glimpsed or other structural details at 
this magnification though the surface brightness is unusually high.  Situated in a rich star field 
but set near the middle of a oval 12'-13' ring of mag 11 and 12 stars which are near the periphery 
of the 17' field at 195x!  Located 8.4' SSW of mag 8.1 HD 102817 and 19' SW of mag 5.6 HD 
103101.  The open cluster N3960 lies 90' N.

18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x, the "Blue Planetary" appears as a 
bright, round disc, ~15" diameter with a vivid blue color (V = 8.2).  The surface brightness is 
very high and the edge of the halo is crisply defined, but no structural details or central star were 
noted.  Good response to UHC filter, although it was unnecessary for a good view.  The Milky 
Way is quite rich here in faint stars but the planetary seems to be set a darker, circular hole 
without the faint background glow - a contrast affect with the PN?

the exact same coordinates to both N3931 and N3917A.  N3931 was not found by Bigourdan.

17.5" (4/7/89): seen as an extremely faint mag 15.5-16.0 stellar object located 1.8' N of N3949.  
Incorrect identification in the RNGC.

In the observation of N3949, the observers at Birr Castle picked up a faint companion described 
on 31 Mar 1872 as "comp neb n about 2.5'."  A later micrometric observation on 27 Apr 1875, 
placed this nova in position angle 356.5d, distance 154.6".  Close to Lord Rosse's position there 
is a very faint galaxy (also catalogued as Ho 301b) which was observable in my 17.5" and 
verified on the POSS.  Reinmuth also identifies this galaxy as N3950 in his 1926 photographic 
survey Die Herschel-Nebel.  Corwin notes it is puzzling that this galaxy is only 1.6' N of N3949 
although Rosse's two observations place it an extra arcmin north (his other micrometric offsets 
for nearby stars are very close).

RNGC identifies N3950 with another very compact companion located almost 5' north of N3949 
which is much further off from the Birr Castle measurements.  The RNGC 1975 coordinates of 
N3950 should be changed to identify the galaxy at 11h 52.4m +48d 02' and the other columns 
updated to reflect this change. Dorothy Carlson is incorrect in stating that N3950 = *.  I'm not 
sure if MCG identifies the same galaxy as RNGC.  Listed in RNGC Corrections #4.

See observing notes for N3986.

Discovered by d'Arrest.  There is nothing at his original position but Wolf (list VIII) suggested 
that d'Arrest's RA was off by 30 tsec and Dreyer copied this "correction" into the IC 2 notes.   
The corrected position matches M+05-28-048 = CGCG 157-056 and this is the galaxy identified 
as N3966 in RNGC, MCG, CGCG and PGC. But Corwin (e-mail from 3/6/98) found that 
d'Arrest's original Latin description did not match this galaxy, particularly the nearby mag 12-13 
star.  Curiously, d'Arrest mentions he was searching for h1027 = N3986 and this galaxy matches 
his description for N3966. The galaxy chosen by Max Wolf as N3966 is actually IC 2981 (also 
with identification problems)!  See NGCBUGS.

See observing notes for N3971 and UGC 6943 (identified as N3984 in modern catalogues).  
Identification not certain.

Discovered by JH (h1026) and described as "eF, R, bM, 25".".  In his description he noted 
"supposed at the time to be II.724 [NGC 3971], but on reducing the obs, it differs 1 min in RA 
and 1 deg in PD, BOTH which can hardly be mistakes".  Thomson feels that the modern 
catalogues (including RC3!) are incorrect in selecting N3984 = U06943 = M+05-28-058 = 
CGCG 157-064 as JH placed N3984 0.1 tmin W of N3986 while U06943 is 1.1 tmin E of 
N3986.  Thomson concludes that N3984 is nonexistent; see Catalogue and CGCG Corrections.  
Not found by Wolf (IC 2 notes).

Corwin agrees that the N3984 ? U06943 but feels that despite the errors in both RA and Dec, 
N3984 is most likely a reobservation of N3971.  These entries were recorded on different sweeps 
and although N3971 was described as "pB, R, bM", there are many situations where Herschel 
made very discordant estimates of brightness.  See NGCBUGS for Corwin's comments.

Discovered by WH (III 325 = N4007) although discovery attribued to Otto Struve in NGC due to 
a bad declination in GC and NGC (2 degrees too far south).  The NGC position matches U06952 
= M+04-28-107 = CGCG 127-120. This correction was noted by Dreyer in Scientific Papers.  
This galaxy is identified as N4005 in UGC, CGCG, MCG, RNGC, RC3.  Since WH was the 
original discoverer of this galaxy his number III 325 = N4007 should apply by historical 
precedence.

N4007 was discovered by WH (III 325) but was reduced incorrectly and the North Polar 
Distance in GC and NGC is two degrees too far south (the offset is 45' south of 4 Comae).  This 
error was caught and corrected by Dreyer in Scientific Papers of William Herschel.  Struve and 
Rosse (object Alpha on the sketch of the cluster) later rediscovered it, so it received the second 
NGC number N4005, this time at the correct place.

All major catalogues identify this galaxy as N4005 although you could argue that by prior 
discovery, III 325 = N4007 should take historical precedence.  In any case, it is clear that N4005 
= N4007.  Unfortunately, because of the two degree error the NGC position falls close to N4003.  
So, Reinmuth (Die Herschel-Nebel), Carlson's NGC/IC Correction list, CGCG, UGC, MCG all 
equate N4007 with N4003 ignoring Dreyer's correction.  See Catalogue Corrections, Malcolm 
Thomson and NGCBUGS.

Discovered by John Herschel (single observation).  His description "eF; has a *9m 5' sf" points 
to a mag 15.0 GSC star at 11 58 41.5 +14 14 04.  There is no non-stellar object near his postion.  
But Malcolm Thomson notes that there is a mag 10 star 5' SSE as in the description.  As an 
alternative, Corwin equates N4109 with IC 755 which is considerably off in RA (2 min 16 sec) 
and Dec (6') but does have a bright star at the required separation.  See NGCBUGS for 
discussion.  This galaxy was host to supernova 1999an.

24" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 260x this is a strange looking one-armed 
spiral.  Overall it appeared quite bright and large with a very irregular shape, 3'x2', and sharply 
concentrated with a fairly small, round core.  The core gradually increases to the center.  
Emerging from the core on the NW end is a fairly well-defined arm that initially extends north in 
the direction of a mag 11.8 star located 3.7' NNW of the center of the galaxy.  This arm then 
sharply curves back counter-clockwise ~135°, bending around to the SW and ends just on the 
outside of a mag 13.5-14 star situated close NE of the core.  On the SE end of the core, a second 
arm begins to emerge but it suddenly terminates, creating a very asymmetric appearance with the 
other long, wrapping arm.  A faint companion, N4027A, lies 4' S.  At 260x, the companion 
appeared faint, fairly small, slightly elongated ~N-S, 25"x20", low even surface brightness.  A 
very faint star is attached at the south end.  The Ring-tail galaxy, N4038/4039 lies 40' NE.

24" (4/10/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this was an amazing object in the 24" at 350x.  
The main, bright northern component (N4038) was partially annular, with a very bright knotty 
rim and a darker center giving a truly unique appearance for a galaxy.  At least 3 knots were 
visible embedded along its rim.  On the south side is the brightest knot which appeared faint, 
small, ~12" diameter.  A second fainter knot is on the SW side and was only ~6" in size.  Finally, 
a third very faint 6" knot is on the N side.  The three knots were roughly spaced out 120° apart 
along the outer portion of this tortured galaxy.  Attached on the east end is a long "tail" or arm 
(interacting companion N4039) that curves around on the south side towards the southwest.  
Another very faint, but slightly larger 20" knot is embedded along the main portion of the tail 
roughly halfway along its length.  At the tip of the main tail was a relatively large, brighter knot 
that at times appeared double.  Surrounding the SW portion of the tail is a much fainter outer 
halo extended SW-NE.  This fainter halo extends beyond the tail for a few arc minutes and 
widens to a bulbous shape at the end. This was by far the most detailed view I've seen of the 
Ring-tail galaxy.  Another disturbed galaxy, N4027, lies SW.

17.5" (5/14/88): fairly bright, moderately large.  Forms a striking "shrimp-like" or "comma" 
shape with the tail attached at the east end and extending to the south.  Appears clearly darker 
between the two objects on the west side.

is embedded along the main portion of the tail roughly halfway.  At the tip of the main tail was a 
relatively large, brighter knot that at times appeared double.  Surrounding the SW portion of the 
tail is a much fainter outer halo extended SW-NE.  This fainter halo extends beyond the tail for a 
few arc minutes and widens to a bulbous shape at the end.  This was by far the most detailed 
view I've seen of the Ring-tail galaxy.

17.5" (5/14/88): this is the southern member of the striking "Ring-Tail galaxy".  Attached at the 
E side of N4038 and forms a "tail" elongated NW-SE.

Discovered by JH along with N4055 and N4059.  His coordinates were very uncertain ("PD very 
doubtful") although the galaxy is described as "B".  It seems very likely that these three entries 
are duplicates and Corwin suggests N4055 = N4061, N4057 = N4065, and N4059 = N4070

Very poor position given by JH (h1064) along with N4055 and N4057 discovered on same

17.5" (3/28/87): extremely faint, very small, round.  Located 2' WSW of N4066 in the N4065

Discovered by Marth on the same night with N4042, N4053 and N4056.  Only N4053 has a 
certain identification.  Marth's position is just 3 tsec W and 2.3' S of CGCG 128-006 and this is 
the identification adopted in RNGC, CGCG and NGCBUGS.  This galaxy is not in MCG or 
RC3.

It is also possible that N4060 = (R)N4056 as this faint galaxy is a very close match with Marth's 
position (although the identification of N4056 would then be unknown).  Finally, it is possible 
that N4060 = (R)N4069 in which case Marth's position is 8 tsec W and 1.4' S, although this 
galaxy is fainter than CGCG 128-006.

18" (7/6/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): I had a difficult time ferreting out this faint PN 
that is buried within a very rich Milky Way field.  It was finally picked up at 76x (27 Panoptic) 
and OIII filter as a faint, round disc at least 40" in diameter.  Removing the filter, a faint star is 
superimposed on the SW side of a low surface brightness glow.  Also viewed unfiltered at 228x 
which showed the faint star and the disc more easily, though this is quite a faint NGC planetary.  
The best view was at 128x using an OIII filter.  The disc appeared fairly faint with subtle 
irregularities in surface brightness and was likely brighter along portions of the rim.

Discovered by WH (III 384) along with N4095 (III 382) and N4098 (III 383) on 26 Apr 26 1785. 
Dreyer suggests in his update of WH's catalogues that possibly he observed N4093, 4095 and 
N4098 on that night and WH observed N4093 and N4095 in 1786.  He mentions N4099 "is 
probably superfluous".  Not found by Reinmuth.  Corwin concurs that N4099 is likely a 
duplicate observation of N4098.

Discovered by d'Arrest and described as a planetary !  His RA was 2 tmin too far E, but once 
corrected his position matches N4078 and is clinched by the "star 10-11 30.2 seconds following, 
1 arcmin south."  Apprently no one made this identification before Corwin who also notes that 
d'Arrest missed nearby N4082 and N4083 which were probably too faint.  In the IC 1 notes, 
Burnham states "delete planetary; the star is np".  This seems to imply Burnham recorded some 
object at the NGC position but in the IC 2 notes Dreyer comments "not found by Frost on plates 
of 4h exposure" [from Annals of Harvard College Observatory, Vol 88, No 1].  Reinmuth writes 
"=*13.5, no nebulosity seen.  *10 ssf 2.6', *13.2 spp 1.4'."  Also listed as a star by Carlson and in

Discovered by WH (II 14). There was a confusion in the reference star in the sweep and the 
galaxy could not be recovered by Bigourdan, Reinmuth or Frost (Annals of Harvard College 
Observatory, Vol 88, No 1).  According to Corwin (See NGCBUGS), NGC 4119 is likely N4124 
as originally suggested by Dreyer in Scientific Papers.  Corwin notes that "WH's final position is 
just 50 arcmin south of N4124, and there are no other bright galaxies nearby that he might have 
picked up."   This galaxy was discovered on one of the early sweeps which often resulted in very 
rough positions.

See observing notes for N4149.

Discovered by WH (III 845).  Herschel's offset from Delta UMa and description (elongated E-
W) points directly to U07167 = M+10-17-155 = CGCG 292-076.  This galaxy was earlier found 
by WH and received the designation N4149 (accurate position given by JH).  Interestingly, 
Bigourdan was not able to find this galaxy and it is described by Reinmuth as "*12?; no neb 
seen; BD +59 1426 nff 3.7'."  Similarly listed as a star by Carlson and RNGC follows suit by 
listing it as nonexistent.  N4154 is not equated with N4149 in any catalogue other than Corwin's 
NGCBUGS.

Discovered by David Todd during his search for a trans-Neptunian planet (AN 2698).  Dreyer 
only included eight of the 30 objects which Todd sketched as many were considered doubtful or 
near nebulae already catalogued.  Todd's sketch of object 18, which includes several nearby field 
stars, clearly identifies it as NGC 4202 = UGC 07337 at 12 18 08.6 -01 03 52 (2000).  This 
means that Todd's rough position used in the NGC was 3 tmin too far west although a number of 
his entries have large errors in RA..

The RNGC misidentifies NGC 4202 = CGCG 013-109 at 12 14.9 -02 27 (2000) and early 
versions of U2000.0 atlas have it misplotted at this position.  I described this galaxy as 
nonexistent in RNGC Corrections #5 but corrected the identification in #6.  Listed in

The galaxy described above is misidentified as N4241 in modern catalogues. It forms a pair with 
IC 3115 (the "real" N4241) 8' ESE.

Discovered by WH (II 137) and reobserved by JH (h1165). However JH identified this galaxy as 
III 480 (N4241) which caused later confusion. In Scientific Papers of WH, Dreyer concludes 
h1165 = N4241 (repeated by Reinmuth and Carlson).  Harold Corwin argues that WH observed 
both II 137 = N4223 = IC 3102 and III 480 = N4241 = IC 3115 and that the brighter, western 
object is II 137 (N4223).  Unfortunately, because of John Herschel's mix-up III 480 was left 
without a number.  So, modern catalogues identify N4241with U07319 = M+01-31-038 = CGCG 
41-065 = IC 3102 instead of N4223.  See NGCBUGS for more on the story.

18" (4/26/08): huge, low surface brightness galaxy roughly 12'x3' NNW-SSE.  Very weak 
concentration with no obvious core.  A very faint star appears to be superimposed near the 
geometric center and just to the south is a slight elongated brightening (possibly the core).  
Another brighter region is near the N end of the galaxy and seems elongated at a 45° to the major 
axis, appearing to extend out to the west of the main glow on the N end (on the DSS this is a 
gigantic HII complex).  The south end is also splotchy and at the very south tip are two very faint 
"stars" that seem quasi-stellar (on the DSS these are small HII knots).

17.5" (3/29/89): faint, extremely large, edge-on 5:1 NNW-SSE.  Appears as a ghostly streak

is identified as N4364 in all modern catalogues although there is a probable identification mix-up 
in the modern catalogues.  See ID notes.

Discovered by WH (III 799) along with III 800 = N4362 and III 801 = N4364.  The latter two 
were described as a "two, both cF, cS, R".  In Scientific Papers of WH, Dreyer notes that "very 
probably the word 'two' refers to III 799 and III 800 although 3 entries were given in GC and 
NGC.

JH, Bigourdan and d'A only found two galaxies (h1230 and h1231) which JH oriented NW 
(h1230) and SE (h1231).  Reinmuth also only found these two gx's and listed N4364 as not 
found.  There are three galaxies here as the NW galaxy is actually a close double (the western 
component was glimpsed as stellar in my 17.5").  CGCG identifies the double as N4358 + 
N4364 and MCG and RNGC both identify the stellar western component as N4358 and the main 
eastern component as N4364.

Corwin feels that it most likely that WH only observed a pair of galaxies as JH, Bigourdan, d'A 
and Reinmuth only picked up the brighter two.  In which case, N4358 =  U07479 = M+10-18-
038 = CGCG 293-017e and N4362 = M+10-18-039.  The third galaxy M+10-18-037 = CGCG 
293-017w would then be anonymous and N4364 probably a duplicate of N4362.  See 
NGCBUGS for the complete story.

Dreyer notes that III 97 was only observed once and not seen when nearby II 144 = N4370 was 
observed.  III 97 was not observed by JH, d'A or at Birr Castle.  The RNGC and PGC 
identification NGC 4366 = MCG +01-32-050 = CGCG 042-087 is very questionable (see visual

24" (4/12/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 260x, this is a highly-resolved, low-
concentration class globular.  A mag 6.6 star just 5.5' NW of center is a bit distracting but scores 
of stars are resolved over the 4' core, appearing to criss-cross the center in numerous lanes.  The 
outer halo is very large, nearly 15' in diameter, and resolved into a couple of hundred stars.  
Except for the brighter, denser core this globular appears similar to a very large, fully resolved 
open cluster. 

18" (7/6/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 171x, this large, bright globular was an 
impressive object and beautifully resolved into 150-200 stars mag 13 and fainter within a 13'-14' 
diameter.  The unresolved background glow was relatively faint for such as a well-resolved 
globular.  The large 4' core is only slightly brighter and there is no nucleus (class 12 
concentration) although a close pair of brighter mag 12.5 stars is near the center.  Scores of stars 
appear linked in chains and loops, particularly in the outer halo, which is quite irregular and 
ragged.  Mag 6.6 HD 107947 lies 5.5' NW of center at the edge of the halo and provides a 
striking contrast although it detracts somewhat from viewing.  A dust lane appears to pierce the 
cluster on the north side for a few arc minutes (east of the bright star) and this dark intrusion may 
be an extension of the "Dark Doodad" (see notes). 

18" (7/7/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 228x, this large, loose globular was well-
resolved into ~100 stars mag 12-15 with a 12' diameter.  The roundish core is ~4' in size with 
many faint stars sprinkled across the core.  The halo is elongated and irregular in shape. A 
starless dark lane appears to wind into the cluster towards the core from the NW side angling 
roughly NW-SE (later verified on the DSS).  A mag 6.8 star lies 5' NW of the core and interferes 
with viewing!  Located 44' SW of mag 3.8 Gamma Muscae.

17.5" (5/15/99): N4395 is a chaotic galaxy dominated by several bright HII regions. At 100x, the 
large low surface brightness glow is clearly clumpy with a couple of faint knots evident on the 
east side of the haze. At 220x, the glow of the galaxy is more difficult to view and several 
nonstellar knots and a couple of very faint superimposed stars are more prominent. The brightest 
HII region is N4401 located 2' SE of the core, ~25" in size, with a second smaller 15" knot 
(N4400) close south. The core of the galaxy appears as an ill-defined low surface brightness 
glow, larger than the individual HII knots.  A mag 14.5 star is superimposed NE of the core. On 
the SW side of the core is a third difficult knot, about 15" in diameter (N4399) requiring averted 
vision to confirm.

17.5": faint, very large, extremely low surface brightness, must use low magnification to view.  
Three knots are involved (one of these observed "knots" may be the core) within a very diffuse 
glow.  The brightest knot (N4401) is at the SE end about 2' SE of center with N4400 close SSW 
of N4401.  A mag 14.5 star is at the N end.  Also see description for N4399.

small, 10"-15" in size and situated 2.3' SW of the ill-defined core on a line with a mag 14.5 star 
to the NE of the core.  Required averted vision to confirm.

This is an HII region or condensation in N4395 on the SW side.  See Rosse sketch which shows 
4 objects (agrees with the POSS) - one of which is the core (furthest N).  Listed in RNGC

at 220x (the galaxy loses its identity at this power!), as an irregular 25" knot.  Off the south side 
is a second fainter knot (N4400).

17.5": brightest of three knots in the galaxy N4395 along with N4399 and N4400.  Appears fairly 
faint and fairly small.  Forms a close pair with knot N4400 just SSW.

Discovered by JH who "resolved" N4395 into two components.  This is his eastern portion which 
actually refers to the brightest of the knots in N4395. See Rosse sketch (which agrees with the

Discovered by JH (h1277).  His position is 5 tmin W of N4517 (similar dec) but his description 
of the galaxy and nearby mag 10 star to NE make this identification certain.  Due to a typo, the 
RNGC has =N4417, instead of N4517.  Reinmuth has "no found, =N4517?" and equated by 
Corwin (See NGCBUGS).

18" (5/14/07): very mottled, irregular appearance, elongated ~2:1 SW-NE, ~5'x2.5'.  The core is 
quite splotchy in appearance with a couple of bright knots, the most prominent is attached to the 
southwest of the core.  The main body is roughly rectangular with an extension at the NW 
"corner" that ends with a bright knot or knots ([HK83] 15).  Another extension or knot is off the 
NE corner.  A mag 13 star lies 2.4' E of the core and 1 or 2 additional very faint stars or knots are 
superimposed in the central region. 

18" (5/8/04): fascinating view of this "Magellanic" system at 323x!  The galaxy is very irregular 
in appearance and surface brightness with a large, bright, elongated core oriented SW-NE.  The 
core appears offset to the south side of the galaxy.

Several knots (giant HII regions) are visible outside the core.  The brightest is a well-defined 
obvious patch on the north edge of the galaxy, 1.5' from the center.  This object is #15 in Hodge-
Kennicutt's 1983 "Atlas of HII regions in 125 galaxies" and it is nearly comparable in surface 
brightness to the core.  Roughly 1' SE is a smaller, faint knot ([HK83] 02) that is collinear with 
#15 and a mag 13.5 star 2.4' east of the core.  A third difficult knot ([HK83] 25) can sometimes 
be glimpsed about 40" SW of [HK83] 15.  Finally, attached on the south end of the core is a 
larger, bright knot, although initially I thought this was just part of the core.

13.1" (4/12/86): very bright, very large, elongated SW-NE, bright core, stellar nucleus.  A knot is 
involved at the north end and the galaxy generally appears brighter to the north of the core.  A 
star is superimposed close E of the core.

Starmaster (disturbed arm on the WNW end extending towards N4490 easily visible) and the 
33.4" f/5 (internal structure visible).

18" (6/13/07): very bright, large, elongated 5:2 WNW-ESE, ~5'x2', with a very bright oval core, 
~45"x30".  The surface brightness is irregular or mottled but most interesting is a small extension 
or arm that juts out of the WNW end and appears to bend or hook north towards the companion 
N4485.  There appears to be a smaller counterpart at the ESE end that slightly protrudes from the 
main body.  With averted vision, the galaxy grows wider and appears ~5'x2.5'.  Located 39' NW 
of mag 4.3 Beta Canum Venaticorum.

18" (6/4/05): very bright, large, elongated 2:1 NW-SE, contains a large, bright core.  At the NW 
end a faint arm appears to emerge hooking sharply to the north for 1' towards N4485.  At the SW 
end, there appears to be slight extension without much curvature near a 16th magnitude star.  The 
central region is weakly concentrated to the center.  Overall, the galaxy has a mottled, slightly 
splotchy appearance as if was dusty or knotty with HII regions.  Located 40' NW of 4.2-
magnitude Beta Canum Venaticorum.

13.1" (2/16/85): very bright, large, striking, elongated 2:1 NW-SE, 6'x3', large bright core is 
elongated and grainy.  A very faint arm extends from the NW end in the direction of N4485 3.6' 
NNW.  A small extension (arm) at the SE end is suspected.  Similar view and sketch made on 
2/23/85.  On 4/12/86, just a hint of curvature was noted towards N4485.

WH's description is of a (resolvable) cluster (III 18). Described by JH (h1315) as "eF, the 
following of 2 in fld." [with N4496].  But this object was not recovered by Bigourdan and there 
is nothing at WH's position. JH's brief description probably applies to a faint star. Reinmuth also 
lists this object in Die Herschel-Nebel although he questions if it is a mag 14 star (it is).  Corwin 
feels WH may have made a duplicate observation of N4496 (using a different reference stars) 
which was observed on the same night. N4505 is also equated with N4496 by Carlson.  See

See observing notes for N4521.  Identification uncertain.

JH's position for h1321 = N4512 precesses to 12 32 08 +63 44 (2000).  This position is 10' NNE 
of U07700 = M+11-15-060, the galaxy identified in all modern catalogues as N4512.  His single 
description of "pB" certainly does not apply to this low surface brightness galaxy and it is 
strange that he would not mention much brighter N4521 just 4' NE observed in the previous 
sweep (described as a "nova" with a 20' error in declination!).

Bigourdan was not able to recover N4512 and Reinmuth states "no pB neb found, =N4521?".  
His description for N4521 mentions U07700 as a "F neb ssp 4.0" although it is not identified as 
N4521. Corwin suggests that N4512 may also be identical to N4510 as this would require a 30' 
error in dec only, although this galaxy is certainly fainter than N4521.  So, the identification with 
N4521 is tentative.  See NGCBUGS.

Size 0.45x0.2

18" (5/12/07): extremely faint and small, round, 10" diameter, required averted vision to 
glimpse, though transparency was very mediocre.  Located near the midpoint of a mag 14 star 
2.3' N and a mag 11 star 2.7' S.  This galaxy is not identified as N4549 in the RNGC or CGCG.  
Located 4.3' ENE of the double system N4547.

Discovered by WH (III 807).  RNGC and CGCG incorrectly identify MCG +10-18-070 = CGCG 
293-030e (fainter member of a double system wth N4547) as N4549. See Thomson's Catalogue 
and CGCG Corrections.  The galaxy identified here as N4549 is not in RC3.

17.5" (4/9/99): bright, large, elongated 5:3 NW-SE, ~7'x3'.  Exhibits a striking, unusual 
appearance with a broad, weak concentration to a large, elongated core.  The overall surface 
brightness is noticeably irregular with hints of brighter and darker spots.  The outer halo has a 
low surface brightness, particularly on the SE end which is wider than the NW side and shows no 
tapering.  A trio of mag 12-12.5 stars cradle the galaxy at this end and there appears to be 
mottling near the superimposed stars.  IC 3550-52, IC 3555, and IC 3563 are HII regions and/or 
star clouds within N4559 discovered by Max Wolf (made no attempt to identify).

See observing notes for N4526.

Discovered by WH (I 119) and placed 49 tsec W and 27' N of I 32 = N4570.  JH has one 
observation which he described this galaxy as "B, L, R, gbM", although the RA is marked ±.  
This object was not found by Bigourdan , Winnecke, Reinmuth and by Schwassmann (IC 2 
notes) on a plate.  It seems probable that N4560 is a duplicate observation of a bright galaxy 
based on the Herschel's descriptions.  Corwin suggest N4526 as a likely candidate with a 2 tmin 
error in RA.  See NGCBUGS for discussion.

Discovered by d'Arrest whose micrometric position matches MCG +05-30-033. This galaxy is 
identified as N4557 in the RNGC.  The galaxy identified as N4563 in CGCG and RNGC is

Discovered by Peters at 12 40 45 -05 08.8 (2000). The discovery must have been communicated 
directly to Dreyer as it does not appear in either of his Copernicus lists.

This object is listed as nonexistent in RNGC based on Carlson's paper on NGC corrections which 
states it was not found at Helwan observatory.  RC3 identifies N4605 = M-01-32-037 at GSC 
position 12 40 45.2 -05 18 11 (2000) which is exactly 10' S of Peter's position.  Although, there 
is no visual description in the NGC, this identification (which is given in ESGC) is reasonable 
assuming a single digit error in declination by Peters.  See RNGC Corrections #6 and 
NGCBUGS.

18" (5/14/07): very bright, large, nearly edge-on 3:1 NW-SE.  The relatively large, bulging core 
is mottled.  The SE extension is brighter, mottled (HII regions) and tapers towards the tip. The 
very tip of this extension appears to hook slightly towards the east. The fainter NW extension is 
much more diffuse, is broader and fades at the ends.  The major axis of the two extensions are 
slightly skewed with respect to each other as if they were bent at the center or possibly the 
brighter SE extension is warped or distorted.

18" (5/8/04): very bright, large, quite elongated 5:2 ~NW-SE.  Contains a relatively large, high 
surface brightness elongated core.  This galaxy's structure is very unusual with careful viewing.  
The SE extension is clearly brighter and more tapered than the NW end.  The surface brightness 
of the SE extension is noticeably uneven with a mottled or splotchy appearance possibly from 
HII regions and an irregular distribution of dust.  Near the center there is a slight bend or kink to 
the major axis and with the fainter NW extension slightly misaligned.  Also the NW extension 
appears to fan out somewhat at the NW edge and fade into the background.

See observing notes for N4665.  Uncertain identification.

Discovered by JH (h1390).  Described as "B, E.  RA ill observed."  His position is 12 42 15.7 
+03 03 32 (2000) although the declination is not stated as uncertain as in the description. 
Reinmuth notes "not found; N4624 = N4636? (repeated by Carlson).  Corwin notes in 
NGCBUGS "During the same sweep, he [JH] made a one-degree error in the polar distance for 
NGC 4636, an error that he himself suggested, and that Dreyer finally rectified for the NGC. 
Thus, NGC 4624 cannot be NGC 4636 as suggested by Reinmuth and adopted by RNGC."

My visual observation described N4636 as only slightly elongated but it is certainly very bright.  
Another possibility is N4624 = N4600 which is moderately bright and closer to h's declination.  
Instead, Corwin suggests "it is most likely NGC 4665 which JH described as ``B, pL'' in two 
other sweeps.  This, and the appearance of the bright bar of the galaxy, matches his terse 
description for N4624, ``B, E.''  In addition, his declination is correct for all three observations. 
There is a faint possibility that N4624 is N4600, but JH's two observations of that make it ``F, S'' 
in contrast to his note on N4624.  In addition, the declination of N4600 is off JH's measured dec 
for N4624."

17.5" (6/5/99): at 280x (14' field) this remarkable galaxy runs edge to edge across the field!  The 
surface brightness is unusually irregular with bright and dark mottling across the surface.  There 
is no well-defined core but a prominent knot is close following (east) the geometric center along 
the north side and a second weaker knot is along the west side.  The north edge has an unusually 
"scalloped" appearance particularly along the west side due to dust and brighter splotches.  The 
galaxy gradually bulges towards the center and tapers at the tips, particularly along the west end.  
A mag 13 star is situated just north of the edge at the geometric center and N4627 appears to 
hover over this "starship" a couple of arcmin NW of center.

13.1" (5/26/84): stunning galaxy, very bright, unusually large and interesting edge-on E-W,

along the major axis.  A mag 13 star is just N of the core.  A companion system N4627 lies 2.6' 
NW of the center.

24" (4/12/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is a classic polar-ring galaxy in Centaurus 
cluster (one of about a 100 known), located  5.6' ENE of N4650.  The polar-ring is the result of 
collision and merger of two galaxies at least 1 billion years ago.  At 200x, it appeared fairly faint, 
fairly small, elongated 3:2  WSW-ENW, 30"x20".  The surrounding "polar-ring" was not 
recorded.

18" (5/14/07): this fascinating galaxy forms one of the most striking pairs in the sky with N4631 
32' NW.  At 220x, the distorted shape extends ~9'x1.5' in a SW-NE orientation.  On first glance, 
it appears the bulging core is offset at the SW end, though with averted vision a very low surface 
brightness broader extension continues to the the SW of the core for several arcminutes before 
fading into the background.  The core is very bright and mottled with a bright knot (HII region) 
jutting out to the west at the southwest end of the core.  The NE extension has a remarkable, 
fairly bright 2' extension (N4657), hooking to the east at a 45° angle from the major axis (the 
"blade" of the hockey stick).  There is a small, faint, detached knot beyond the east end of the 
"blade" that appears to have broken off.  The unusual bend and knot at the NE end is a result of a 
prior tidal interaction with its more massive neighbor, N4631.

13.1" (4/10/86): striking!, fairly bright, very elongated SW-NE.  Appears wider and brighter at 
the SW end.  The NE end hooks sharply east to merge with N4657 which may be a part of 
N4656 and not a separate galaxy. A star or knot is attached at the south end.  Appears like a 
celestial hockey stick!

Discovered by JH (h1421). Not found by Reinmuth, Frost, d'Arrest and Vogel.  As h described 
this object as bright, it seems likely that is a duplicate observation of a bright galaxy with a poor

nebulous in poor seeing?  In NGCBUGS, Corwin suggests "NGC 4667 is probably = NGC 4638

18" (5/16/09): extremely faint, very small, slightly elongated, 15"x12".  Based on this description 
I only viewed the core region of this thin edge-on.  Located 1.2' SSE of a mag 12 star and 4.5' 
NW of the NGC 4724/4727 duo.  The identification of this NGC number is uncertain and most 
other sources equate it with IC 3834.

Discovered by Tempel (V) in 1882.  Corwin equates this object with an extremely faint spindle 
galaxy 4.7' NW of the pair NGC 4724/4727.  This galaxy is not identified as NGC 4726 in other 
catalogues.  NGC 4726 has been identified in the past with IC 3834 (see notes).

Tempel claimed NGC 4726 was discovered 4' N of a double nebula (N4724/4727) whereas 
Bigourdan's IC 3834 is 38 tsec of RA further E.  Howe's corrected position in the IC 2 notes for 
NGC 4726 is a perfect match for IC 3834, so he picked this galaxy.  See Thomson's Catalogue 
Corrections as well as Corwin's NGCBUGS.

SW.  In NGCBUGS, Corwin identifies N4729 = E323-016 and N4730 = E323-017 as the most 
likely candidates (first suggested by Ron Buta) and this identification is also given in ESO.  
MCG does not make the NGC identification (M-07-27-002 and -003).  RNGC misidentifies 
N4729 with E323-008.  See NGCBUGS for further discussion on confusion with these galaxies

Discovered by Swift (VI).  Swift and Howe claimed that N4740 was equivalent to N4726 in the

that N4740 = IC 3834, a faint edge-on about 6' S of Swift's position and the closest galaxy in the

brighter galaxy that precedes Swift's position by 50 seconds.

13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x, 120-150 stars are resolved in the Jewel Box cluster with 
careful viewing as a huge number of mag 13-14 stars form a rich carpet in the background of a 
half-dozen very bright stars in the cluster.  Most prominent is a string of three 6-7th magnitude 
stars including orange-red DU Crucis (V = 7.2-7.7) with the brightest stars forming a letter "A" 
asterism. The star distribution is very irregular and a number of stars are arranged in strings, 
loops, pair and triplets.  This small naked-eye cluster is just north of the Coalsack and roughly 
one degree SE of mag 1.3 Mimosa (Beta Crucis).

12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): the Jewel Box cluster is a beautiful, naked-eye cluster about a 
degree SE of Beta Crucis.  At 186x, the cluster includes a half-dozen very bright stars (mag 6-
7.5) set over a rich background of scores of mag 9-13 stars within a compact 10' diameter.  A 
line of three mag 6-7 crosses the center of cluster from NW to SE with a striking orange-red star 
(DU Crucis = SAO 252073) near the center.  Other stars have blue-white and yellow-whites 
tints, though these are more subdued.  To the south of the cluster is the remarkable 6°x4° oval 
dark Coalsack which sits adjacent to the SE side of the Southern Cross.

This galaxy is not listed in MCG or RC3.  My observation was verified on the POSS, although 
the galaxy appears almost stellar. The RNGC photographic description of N4829 describes the 
elongated system N4823 2' N, so it appears that the RNGC has misidentified N4829 although the

24" (4/12/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 260x this is a gorgeous highly resolved 
globular with several hundred stars splashed across the core and within a loose, well-resolved 
halo.  The center is strongly compressed with a very bright 3' core surrounded by a large halo, 
roughly 10' in diameter.  Beyond 5' or 6' out from the center the halo becomes scraggly but 
continues to extend out in loops and strings.  A brighter mag 8.7 is superimposed in the halo, 2.5' 
N of center.

18" (7/10/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): This was a surprising find for a little known 
globular!  At 171x, it appeared as a bright, fairly large globular of low concentration class.  The 
loose halo was highly resolved and numerous stars were splashed across the brighter core.  Many 
of the stars formed large loops and chains.  A single bright star (mag 8.7 SAO 256996) is 
superimposed on the northern side of the halo.  The core spans roughly 3', while outliers increase 
the overall halo to at least 10' [John Herschel gave similar dimensions].  Located 42' NNW of 
mag 3.6 Delta Muscae and 3° NE of gc N4372 which is a comparable cluster.

Discovered by WH (III 758) on 23 March 1789 along with NGC 4879 (III 759) and NGC 4888 
(II 778).  One position was given for both NGC 4878 and 4879 but there is only one galaxy (M-
01-33-064) near this position.  Corwin suggests N4879 may be a star about 1.5' SE of this gx.  
MCG (-01-33-064/064a) identifies this as a double galaxy but apparently this is a plate defect on 
the POSS.  Reinmuth identifies a star NE of the galaxy as N4878 and the galaxy as N4879.  
Corwin feels this is less likely. See write-up in NGCBUGS.

Discovered by WH (II 778).  Observed once by JH (h1505). The NGC position (from JH) and

RNGC.  As WH observed N4878, N4879 and N4888 on the same night, these numbers must 
refer to different objects.  More likely, N4879 is nonexistent (possibly a star 1.5' SE of N4878).

Discovered by WH (V 3) and placed 104 min following 75 Leonis!  The position was not 
determined with accuracy according to Dreyer and there were no subsequent sightings by other 
observers.  This object was not recovered by Reinmuth and Carlson and it is listed as nonexistent 
in RNGC.  Corwin suggest that N910 may possibly be a duplicate observation of N4845 with a 
poor RA as it is the "only reasonable candidate."  See NGCBUGS.

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): remarkable spiral at 200x as it extended SW to 
NE over 2/3 of the 30' field.  I didn't take detailed notes on this observation but the galaxy had 
just a broad concentration with no defined core region.  The galaxy is very slightly wider through 
the center and only tapers towards the tips.  Along the south edge, just SW of center, is a brighter 
linear streak forming a sharp edge (the dust lane is just beyond).  The main body of the galaxy 
fades a bit in this area and then brightens again further SW.  Near the NE tip the major axis 
appears slightly warped or bent towards the north.  On the south side of the NE end, some very 
faint haze is visible.  The DSS image reveals this is the portion of the galaxy south of the dust 
lane.

13.1" (2/19/04 - Costa Rica): beautiful, huge edge-on spiral oriented SW-NE. At 166x, appears 
~15'x2' with tapering tips that fade out towards the ends of the extensions.  There is only a broad 
concentration with gently bulging core, although the surface brightness is somewhat irregular or 
mottled due to dust.  The galaxy fades a bit to the SW of the core and then brightens slightly 
further SW.  The NE extension seems a bit splotchy or mottled.  I was very surprised that the 
view from Costa Rica was a bit better than from Bargo, outside of Sydney, Australia, with a 
similar aperture.

12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): this long edge-on spiral is fairly bright and broadly 
concentrated with a slightly bulging core, extending SW-NE ~14'x2.5'.  The surface brightness is 
relatively uniform with a weak central brightening and dimming towards the tips.  Set in a rich 
star field peppered with faint stars.  Located just N of a line connecting mag 4.8 Xi 1 Centauri 
18' ESE and mag 4.3 Xi 2 31' SE.  N4976 is situated 30' E. Member of the Centaurus Group that 
includes both M83 and NGC 5128 and reddened by dust within our galaxy.  N4945 is 
comparable in dimensions to N4565 although the dust lane on the south edge was not evident.

See observing notes for N4961.  Identification uncertain.

Discovered by d'Arrest.  Not found by Bigourdan, Reinmuth (also repeated by Carlson) or Wolf 
(Kongistuhl-Nebel List #9) and there is no entry for this number in UGC, CGCG, MCG or RC3.  
Max Wolf felt that N4960 was a duplicate of N4961.  Corwin also feels NGC 4960 is likely 
NGC 4961 with a 15' error in the declination as d'A recorded N4960 "only once, on a night when 
he did not record N4961 (he observed that on four other nights."  See NGCBUGS.

RNGC is the only modern catalogue to list N4960 and it is identified with a faint galaxy at GSC 
position 13 05 53.1 +27 33 07.  This position is 6 tsec following and 4' N of the NGC position. 
Malcolm Thomson feels this identification is reasonable.

Discovered by WH (III 303) and placed 43 tsec of RA preceding and 4' N of III 304 = h1531 = 
N4966 (imprecise coordinates from WH).  III 303 was not found by Bigourdan, Reinmuth or 
Wolf. There is a mag 13.8 star very close to H's offset.  Wolf suggests that N4962 may be 
identical to #65 in list 9 at GSC position 13 05 48.9 +28 06 23 which implies the NGC 
declination is off by 1 degree (but matches in RA), but this would place it beyond the limits of 
WH's sweep according to Dreyer.  Corwin feels a more likely identification is N4962 = N4952 
with a 1 tmin error in RA and similar descriptions. Discussed in detail in NGCBUGS.

Discovered by WH (III 781) on 14 Apr 1789 along with N4967 and N4974.  The RA was 
roughly one tmin too large, but the positions for N4973 and N4974 were corrected by Rümker

N4973 = M+09-22-006 = CGCG 270-049.  Also see Dreyer's Scientific Papers of WH (1912) 
which lists all the problems on two of H's sweeps.  Swift's IC 847 is a duplicate listing  (although 
the IC RA is 30 tsec too large, Swift's original position is OK).

N4973 is misidentified in RNGC, MCG, CGCG, N2000 and RC3.  The galaxy listed under 
N4973 in RNGC, RC3 and CGCG is N4974.  The galaxy identified as N4973 in MCG is +09-
22-11.  N2000, MOL and Carlson all equate N4974 = IC 847 although Swift's corrected position 
for IC 847 in AN #3004 implies (corrected) N4973 = (corrected) IC 847.  N4973 is identified as 
IC 847 in CGCG but listed correctly in N2000.  See CGCG Corrections, Thomson and 
NGCBUGS to sort out this confusing situation!

Corwin also notes that WH's description of the relative positions of N4973 and N4974 are in 
error.  Instead of N4973 being 3' or 4' south-preceding it should be "north-preceding".

Discovered by Swift and placed at 13h 16.3m -12 19 (1950) in a relatively scattered group of six 
galaxies including NGC 5072, 5076, 5077, 5079, 5088.  Nearby N5072, discovered by d'Arrest, 
was accurately placed at 13h 16.6m -12 17 (1950).  So, Swift's position for N5070 is 19 tsec of 
RA preceding and 2' south of N5072 (accurately placed by d'Arrest) but there is no object at this 
position.

The RNGC has identified N5070 with a very faint edge-on galaxy (M-02-34-023) located 3' 
NNE of N5072.  Although imprecise coordinates by Swift could possibly account for this 
discrepancy, his original discovery description provides another solution: "eeF, eS, vf * v close, 
looks like a D* at first; another nr; 6 in field."  The only galaxy nearby that matches this 
description is N5072 = M-02-34-022 which has a 14th magnitude star superimposed on the south 
end causing the initial impression of a faint double star. So, given Swift's description, N5070 
should be listed as nonexistent in the RNGC with new description "=N5072."  Listed in RNGC 
Corrections #3 although I incorrectly concluded that the RNGC had reversed the identifications 
of N5070 and N5072.

See observing notes for N5109.  CGCG identifies this number with CGCG 294-034.

Discovered by WH (III 808) but given a poor declination.  In Dreyer's 1912 revision of WH's 
catalogues, he comments on III 808: "Is no doubt identical with II 826 [N5113], both observed 
once only and in different sweeps.  Carlson repeats this equivalence and Corwin concludes that 
WH's N5113 is probably a duplicate observation of N5109 (similar descriptions).

12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): at 186x, Centaurus A appeared very bright with a large, 
prominent dust lane cutting a dark swath through the center from NW-SE.  The SW hemisphere 
is a bit larger and more prominent and contains a bright star.  There is a mag 12 star within the 
dust lane (west of center) with two very faint stars at both NW and SW borders of the lane.  
Some faint haze is superimposed near the center of the dark rift, following the star superimposed 
on the lane.

20" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): at 230x, Cen A nearly fills the 15' field.  The 15'x1' dark rift is 
fascinating with a scalloped, wavy edge and a thin streak is easily visible near the center within 
the rift.  This was easily the most detailed view I've ever had of Cen A.

17.5" (3/12/88): bright, large, very large prominent dust lane oriented NW-SE.  The SW 
hemisphere is larger and and brighter.  A star is superimposed at the south edge of the dust lane 
(west of center) and a bright star is superimposed on the SW hemisphere (south of center). 

13" (4/24/82): wide dust lane bisects galaxy with the SW hemisphere dominating in terms of size 
and brightness.  A very faint star is at the SW edge of the dust lane.

76x (27 Panoptic), barely stands out as a distinct group as it resides in a very rich star field. 
Includes over two dozen mag stars roughly 11th magnitude. Two mag 8.5/9.5 stars (HD 116721

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 200x in excellent seeing, the view was 
absolutely stunning as the field was packed with thousands of pinpoint stars to the edge of the 30' 
field!  I noted the circular ring of stars near the center mentioned previously, but the large 
number of brighter, densely packed stars in the core and halo, superimposed on an incredibly 
rich mat of fainter stars was the real show.  The cluster is only broadly concentrated with very 
large, brighter core ~10' in diameter and the star density thins out very slowly all the way to 35' 
diameter.

18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): although I've mentioned this feature on 
previous observations I was surprised to be drawn to a 1' circular ring of stars just north of the 
geometric center which is mainly filled with unresolved glow and appears like a darker "hole" 
near the center.  A second smaller and less distinct 30" ring of stars and darker center is adjacent 
to the south with the two rings externally tangent in the middle.

After the observation I checked John Herschel's description and found these comments on the 
star rings in the center: "One of these rings, 1.5' in diameter, is so marked as to give the 
appearance of a comparative darkness like a hole in the centre.  My attendant (J.S.) called up, 
who saw the hole and darkness, and described it as I have done above. On further attention the 
hole is double, or an oval space crossed by a bridge of stars. Position of axis = 150."

13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): at 105x in excellent seeing, the view was absolutely breathtaking 
with wall-to-wall pinpoint stars in the 37' field!  There was a clear 3-dimensional effect with the 
11.5-12.5 magnitude stars seemingly floating over a dense mat of fainter stars with the streamers 
in the halo reaching the edges of the field. I don't recall a more impressive view in the 12" from 
Australia, where the cluster was higher in the sky. 

13.1" (2/19/04 - Costa Rica): In very good seeing early in the morning of the 20th, Omega Cen 
was a mesmerizing sea of a couple of thousand stars at 200x.  I set Omega just outside the field 
and let it drift through the field a few times.  The outer halo was an amazingly dense swarm of 
12-13th magnitude stars over a background of fainter pinpoints of lights overspilling the field.  
Very broadly concentrated to a large, brighter center which is denser although there is no well-
defined core.

20" (7/08/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 208x with a 24' field, the cluster overfilled 
the field with edge to edge stars mag 11.5 and fainter and was a breathtaking sight.  Broadly 
concentrated with large, brighter core of at least 10' in diameter which is extremely densely 
packed with layers of stars.  The elongated halo gradually thins but has no definite border out to 
30'!  This is the largest and brightest globular in the sky (V = 3.7) and an obvious naked-eye blur, 
but lacks the strong central condensation of NGC 104 = 47 Tucana.

12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): this was the first object I viewed at Bargo with Les Dalrymple's 
12" and was not disappointed.  At 140x, it filled 2/3 of the field (over 25') and resolved into 
perhaps a few thousand stars down to the center.  The cluster seemed almost 3-dimensional with 
a lattice of brighter mag 12 stars superimposed on a dense background layer of mag 13-14 stars.  
The density was generally uniformly high in the elongated halo except near the edge although 
the core shows more non-uniformity with a couple of darker patches.

17.5" (3/12/88): very large, very bright, fantastic at 220x with several hundred stars resolved in 
excellent seeing from east of Mt. Hamilton.  Very faintly visible to the naked eye in good 
conditions near the horizon from northern California.  

13.1" (3/24/84): large, mottled disc covered with faint stars, well resolved outer halo.  Similar 
view but even better resolution on 2/23/85.

8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): very bright, very large, very broadly concentrated, about 25' 
diameter, over 100 stars resolved mag 12-13, many in curving streams over the entire disc.  
Visible naked-eye.

and HII regions) was host to a pair of recent supernovae - 1998E and 1974B.

See observing notes for N5174.

Discovered by Swift (VI).  His position 13 28 17 +11 01 23  (2000) is 15' S of U08472 located at 
GSC coordinates 13 29 13.6 +11 16 33 (J2000).  RNGC and RC3 identify this galaxy as N5162 
but it is not identified as N5162 in UGC (08472) or CGCG (072-084) and not listed in MCG.  
Due to the large discrepancy in dec, Thomson feels this object is more likely nonexistent.  There 
is also a mag 13.3/14.7 pair with the faint star to the NE near Swift's position which also matches 
his visual description.  So, the correct ID is very uncertain.

In NGCBUGS,  Corwin states that N5162 = N5174 with a 1 tmin error in RA (too small).  
Swift's description "F, pL, eE [not lE as in the NGC]; an
eeF * at each focus of ellipse; B * in field sp; F * nr nf'' is an exact match to NGC 5174.

18" (7/11/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): gorgeous low power Milky Way field at 76x, 
but it was difflicult to identify the cluster not having a finder chart.  Initially I was drawn to a 
striking asterism in the field consisting of a distinctive group of four stars forming a rough 8'x3' 
parallelogram with brightest member mag 7.8 HD 117356, but the enclosed stars were no richer 
than the surrounding field and it looked like an asterism.  Then I noticed that 12' S of the mag 7.8 
star was an eye-catching double star = HJ 4591 (10.2/10.4) at 7" surrounded by a few faint stars 
over unresolved haze.  Increasing the magnification to 228x, this rich knot resolved into three 
dozen mag 14 and fainter stars in a 2'x1.5' roundish cluster with the double star on the following 
side and this was clearly N5138.

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this was the final object of 78 that I logged on 
4/11/08 and the perfect end to a great evening with the 24".  At 200x using a UHC this amazing 
planetary displayed an extremely complex morphology.  Through the center is a bright, high 
surface brightness "bar" elongated WSW-ENE and ~1.5'x0.4' in size.  This central feature has an 
uneven surface brightness with a mottled texture. A mag 12 star is superimposed just N of the 
WSW end and the fainter central star is just south of the bar.  A close double star (~3.5") is 
superimposed just S of the WSW end.  At the WSW end, a spiral extension hooks around 
counterclockwise to the north and passes through a faint star and then ends at a very faint small 
knot just north of the superimposed star.  Just south of the ENE end of the central "bar" is a 
bright 10" knot.  Attached to this knot is another extension that sweeps towards the southwest, 
ending less than 1' S of center.  About 50" E of the bright knot is another 10" knot that appears 
detached.  A mag 12 star is ~50" SW of this knot, just outside the halo of the planetary.  All of 
the brighter features are within a much fainter oval envelope, ~2.5'x2.0'.

18" (7/6/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): the "Spiral Planetary" is certainly one of the 
most remarkably structured planetaries and would be famous if located in the northern 
hemisphere.  At 128x using a UHC filter, a high surface brightness "bar" at least 1' in length, 
elongated SW-NE forms the main body of the planetary.  The bar is slightly curved and has an 
irregular surface brightness.  On the NE end is a prominent bright knot, roughly 6" in size.  
Nebulosity hooks below this knot, extending below the bar.  Above the SW end of the bar is the 
brightest superimposed star and a hook of nebulosity sweeps up to the NW, wrapping above this 
star.  The entire structure is encased in a much fainter oval envelope.  A total of five stars are 
superimposed including a very close double which is just south of the SW end of the bar and the 
14th magnitude central star situated SE of the center of the bar.

12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): this is a bright, strange-looking PN with a complex bar 
structure dubbed the "Spiral Planetary".  At 140x and UHC filter, it resembles a small barred 
spiral galaxy with prominent bar extending SW-NE with curved tips, ~1' in length embedded 
within a fainter, slightly elongated halo of ~2'x1.5'.  A few stars are superimposed.  At 186x, the 
"bar" is irregular and knotty with a bright knot at one end.  A mag 11 star is at the SW end with a 
couple of faint stars on the opposite end. The faint 14th magnitude central star is just south of the 
bar.  Set in a rich star field in the NE corner of Musca 6' NNW of mag 7.2 SAO 252366.  This is 
a fascinating sight!

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia):  M83 had a photographic appearance in the 24" 
at 200x.  The bright "bar" was elongated SW-NE and roughly 3'x1' in size with a well-defined 
bright, round core, 1' in diameter.  The first prominent arm is attached at the NE end of the bar 
and sweeps south (counter-clockwise) on the east side of the core, wrapping around the 
southwest side and spreading out a bit as it terminates to the south of the core (~3' from the 
center).  This arm has a high contrast along its outer edge and a couple of faint stars are 
superimposed near where it attached to the bar.  On the southwest end of the bar a second 
prominent inner arm emerges and abruptly wraps counter-clockwise around the galaxy on the 
west side as it heads north.  This arm continues to wrap around the north side before spreading 
out on the NE side and merging into the outer halo ~3.5' from center on the NE edge of the halo. 
A more ill-defined third arm also emerges from the core on the south but sweeps more gently to 
the west (instead of heading north) on the outside of the second arm.  It spreads out and fades 
into the general glow about 3.5' SW of center near a mag 13-13.5 star.  Offshoots of the main 
arms are difficult to trace and contribute to the general background glow of the halo.

18" (7/11/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): in addition to the complex 3-armed spiral 
structure I was surprised to see a fairly obvious linear bar that extended through the small, 
intense core in SW-NE orientation.  The fairly tightly wound spiral arm that wraps from the east 
side of the core around the south side in a counter-clockwise orientation clearly emerges from 
the NE end of this bar.  The spiral arms that begin on the south and west side more vaguely 
emerge from the general glow near the SW end of the bar.

13.1" (2/20/04 - Costa Rica): beautiful view with easy spiral structure in excellent seeing 
conditions.  The main central portion of the galaxy appears to be in motion, due to the embedded 
spiral structure and darker ribbons add to this impression.  The three principal arms extending 
from the galaxy were well seen although they are fairly tightly wound to the main body.

13.1" (2/19/04 - Costa Rica): this impressive galaxy was viewed carefully at both 105x and 166x.  
The overall size including the spiral arms are ~8'x6'.  The halo is broadly concentrated then rises 
sharply to an intense 25" core that increases to the center.  Complex spiral structure is quite 
obvious.  A spiral arm is attached on the east side of the core and wraps around the south side of 
the galaxy in a counter-clockwise direction.  A second arm is attached at the south side of the 
core and winds to the west a bit on the south side.  FInally, an arm is attached on the west side 
and shoots north before gently bending east along the north side of the outer halo.

12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): this was my best view of M83 with a beautiful spiral structure 
clearly evident with multiple knotty arms.  Well concentrated with a prominent core and very 
small nucleus.  A very long, spiral arm is attached on the west side of the central core or bar but 
quickly bends to the north, becoming more spread out and diffuse.  It continues to wind along the 
entire east side of the halo and fades out near a close double star which is the middle of three 
collinear stars to the SE of the galaxy.  Two other principal arms are visible - one is attached on 
the following end of the core and heads south, wrapping clockwise around the core towards the 
west.  A third arm emerges from the core on the west side and winds clockwise towards the 
north.  Offshoots of the main arms are difficult to trace and contribute to the general background 
glow of the halo.

17.5" (5/10/86) : brighter arm or arc visible north of the core.

13.1" (3/24/84): very bright, large, very bright core, brighter along the central "bar".  The shape 
of the spiral arms and central bar form the Greek letter "Theta" surrounded by a faint halo.

8": very bright, bright core, elongated, impressive.

This galaxy is a good match with JH's position for h3538.   Interestingly, his offset from N5302, 
whose RA was 31 tsec too large, places h3538 much closer E445-035, a slightly fainter galaxy 
(see notes).  But HC feels that Herschel's other positions are all reasonably close, and even 
assuming a 30 tsec error there would still be a residual error of -5 tsec (large amount) and so 
N5298 = E445-039 = M-05-33-015 (as in ESO/Uppsala and RC3) is the straightforward 
explanation.  See e-mail of 9 Jan 2001 and NGCBUGS.

18" (7/5/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): fairly bright, small, blue-green oval, ~15"x10".  
This unusual planetary has an irregular, wispy surface brightness with fascinating glimpses of 
structure at 293x and 428x.  It appears brighter along the major axis, particularly at the south end 
with a couple of small, darker areas or regions where the nebulosity is weaker on the sides.  A 
trio of mag 13-14 stars to the SE is collinear with the planetary.  Situated in a fairly rich star 
field.  See Hubble image of bipolar spiral structure at

10" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): at 214x and UHC filter, this small, fairly bright planetary 
appeared as a slightly elongated disc, ~13"x10" in diameter with a high, fairly even surface 
brightness except for a weak brightening at the center, but no definite central star.  Set in a rich 
star field 45' ENE of gc N5286 and mag 4.7 M Centauri.  Observation with Don Whiteman's 
scope from Bargo, Australia.

18" (7/11/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 76x I immediately noticed a 15' irregular 
chain of two dozen stars, roughly forming the outline of an animal - approximating a dog or 
horse.  Within the position of the "head" of this figure is a pair of equal mag 10.5 stars at 11" 
separation.  In fact,  many of the brighter stars are 10th-11th magnitude.  This chain is well 
detached in the field so it stands out well, although there are no dense spots and this loose group 
appears to be an asterism.  Upping the magnification to 228x, at least 80 stars are visible within a 
15' region.  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.

18" (5/16/09): fairly bright, fairly large, slightly elongated ~E-W, 1.5'x1.3'.  Contains a bright, 
20" core.  This is the brightest member and sits at the core of ACO S753.  Several faint members 
are in the field including a pair of galaxies 5.7' and 7.2' SW (2MASX J14030791-3401581 and 
2MASX J14031458-3401181) and ESO 384-037 is 5.7' due S.    A mag 14.8 GSC star is 3.4' S 
but it appeared slightly fuzzy.  The DSS reveals a compact anonymous galaxy on the S side of 
the star, so I probably noticed the unresolved glow of both objects.

13.1" (4/10/86): fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated, brighter core (outer halo not seen).  
Very easy object at a fairly low elevation.  Brightest member of the cluster ACO S753 (no other

17.5" (6/7/97): this is the bright HII region on the W side of M101 8' SW of center.  Connected

Discovered by Lord Rosse - this is one of the numerous "knots" in M101 on his 1861 sketch

vision to glimpse.  More difficult than two mag 15.5 stars separated by 13", which are location 1' 
WSW.  The combined glow of these stars could easily mislead the observer into logging these as 
N5451! 

18" (6/21/03): initially I picked up a small, hazy glow nearly collinear with a mag 12.9 star just 
N of the core of M101 and a slightly fainter star due W.  But in good moments, this very small 
glow resolved into two stellar objects, probably appearing slightly hazy due to the background 
glow of the outer halo.  After a more careful view, I noticed an extremely faint knot with averted 
vision, ~15" diameter, located ~2' ENE of this pair -- this is N5451.  It seems likely that the 
observation from 6/7/97 refers to the pair of faint stars which initially confused me.

17.5" (6/7/97): this is a difficult, low contrast HII region in M101 located ~5' WNW of center.  
Appears very faint, extremely small, round, starry center?

HII region in M101 discovered by Lord Rosse and estimated position in GC/NGC from JH based

18" (6/21/03 and 6/28/03):  the following HII regions were observed --
NGC 5447: at 215x this fairly prominent HII region appeared as an elongated patch oriented 
NNW-SSE, perhaps 25"x8", located just south of a mag 13.5 star.  At 323x this patch clearly 
resolved into two sections -- within 30" of the star is a very compact knot, ~6"-10" diameter.  
There may be a small gap to the south with a larger extension to the SSE (this is N5450).  
Located on the opposite side of M101 as N5462.

NGC 5449: marginal object at 323x, but backing down to 215x a weak but definite glow was 
visible, perhaps 15"-20" diameter.  Located 3.5' N of N5457.

NGC 5450: See description for N5447.  N5450 appeared just resolved from N5447 at 323x and 
was an elongated patch oriented NNW-SSE, ~20"x6".  The entire complex spans ~45".

NGC 5451: (6/28/03) very difficult, low surface brightness glow, ~10"-15" in size, requiring 
averted vision to glimpse.  More difficult than two mag 15.5 stars separated by 13", which are 
location 1' WSW.  The combined glow of these stars could easily mislead the observer into 
logging these as N5451! 
On 6/21/03 I initially picked up a small, hazy glow nearly collinear with a mag 12.9 star just N 
of the core of M101 and a slightly fainter star due W.  But in good moments, this very small 
glow resolved into two stellar objects, probably appearing slightly hazy due to the background 
glow of the outer halo.  After a more careful view, I noticed an extremely faint knot with averted 
vision, ~15" diameter, located ~2' ENE of this pair -- this is N5451.

NGC 5453: required averted and concentration to confirm a small, low surface brightness glow, 
just visible over the background glow of the spiral arm this HII region resides.  In fact, between 
N5453 and the core is an inner arm which contains a couple of HII knots which are more 
evident!

Anon knot: two small, low contrast knots are visible in the spiral arm that is attached on the west 
side of the core of M101 and wraps around the south side towards the east. These are situated 
just 1.7' SW of the center of M101.  Although this knotty structure does not have a NGC number 
it is slightly more evident than a few of the faintest NGC HII regions.

NGC 5455: compact knot, round, easily identified as forms the southern vertex of a triangle with 
two 13th magnitude stars to the NW and NE.  At moments, a stellar nucleus or superimposed star 
pops out at 323x.

NGC 5458: very faint glow 3' S of the core of M101 on a line between a 13th magnitude star ~7' 
S of the center of M101.  Requires averted for a definite sighting and appears to have a low, even 
surface brightness, ~20" diameter.  Easier to view than N5453.

NGC 5461: at 435x (5.2mm Pentax) a fairly bright quasi-stellar knot is attached at the NE end 
with a relatively faint extension (even surface brightness) extending to the SW.  On 6/21 at 215x, 
this prominent HII region has a high surface brightness and stands out well.  Increasing the 
power to 435x, there is a stellar or quasi-stellar core offset at the NE end with a faint extension to 
the SW.  Backing down to 323x and using a UHC filter, the glow decreases in size, but the star-
like core seems to increase slightly in contrast.

NGC 5462: (6/28/03) this HII region is probably the largest continuous piece.  It appears very 
elongated 3:1 or 7:2 SW-NE, roughly 60"x18". On 6/21 appeared fairly bright and relatively 
large, elongated 3:1, ~50"x17" SW-NE.  This HII region has an irregular surface brightness with 
a bright, nearly stellar knot at the NE end.

NGC 5471: (6/28/03) highest surface brightness of any of the HII regions in M101.  Appears 
very similar to a small, elliptical galaxy -- even contains a small, brighter core.  Situated beyond 
the main glow of the galaxy, 11.5' NE of the core of M101.  On 6/21 at 323x appears similar to a 
compact, round galaxy.  Furthest NE of all the HII regions and well separated from the main 
glow of M101.  Interestingly, this was one of the few HII regions that did show a positive 
contrast response to a UHC filter at 161x and 215x.

13.1" (6/4/84):  four HII regions resolved including N5447, N5458, N5461, N5462.

13.1" (4/24/82): fairly bright, very large, round, about 20' diameter, bright core.  Fairly low 
surface brightness but beautifully resolved into several distinct arms and sections of arms with a 
pinwheel design.  Obvious mottling along the spiral arms which appear clumpy with two or more 
easily recognized HII regions. At least six stars are superimposed.

17.5" (6/7/97): low contrast 25" knot superimposed on the main body of M101 3.0' due south of 
center.  Visibility is hindered as superimposed on the brighter background of the central region.

collinear).  The NGC identification is very uncertain but if UGC 9084 was misidentified by 
Tempel as N5482, then this identification from Corwin is plausible.

This object was discovered by Tempel in the N5416 group and described in his list VIII (AN 
2527).  This is a confusing situation because Tempel's observation appears to place this object 24 
tsec of RA following N5482 although Dreyer misinterpreted his description as following N5463.  
So the NGC position is incorrect.  The RNGC has misidentified N5469 as CGCG 074-062 = 
M+02-36-018.  This galaxy is a close companion of N5423 and is roughly 90' from Tempel's

Located 17' NW of N5529.  This galaxy is identified as N5524 in modern catalogues.

Discovered by Lord Rosse in observation of the N5529 field.  M+06-31-081 = CGCG 191-067 is 
a reasonable match with Rosse's offset of "another vF about 15' np 1764 [N5529]" but Corwin 
feels this galaxy should be labeled N5527 which is described by Rosse "vF" as opposed to "eeF" 
for N5524.  No other catalogue gives this identification, though, except for NED.  This leaves no 
obvious identification for N5524 (instead of N5527).  See Corwin's comments in NGCBUGS 
under N5524 and N5527.

24" (4/11/08 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 260x I was very impressed with this large, 
bright barred spiral.  The halo is slightly elongated, ~3.5'x3.0' and sharply concentrated with a 
very bright, small, core.  Extending through the center is a brighter bar oriented E-W with a star 
superimposed on this bar to the west of the core.  A second superimposed star lies 35" to the 
south and continuing on this line is a third star just at the edge of the halo, 1.7' S of center.  At 
the east end of the bar a slightly enhanced arc sweeps clockwise to the north and a similar 
enhancement on the west side sweeps to the south.  The faint arc or arms wrap around 180° 
making a complete outer ring. The central bar and the outer ring together form the Greek letter 
"theta".  Situated in a fairly rich Lupus star field.

18" (7/5/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): fascinating glimpses of structure at 228x!  This

in the halo due to the strong impression of clockwise spiral structure but there was only a broad, 
weak concentration in the center except for a sharply concentrated, bright 15" nucleus. A broad 
spiral arm is attached on the east side of the galaxy shooting sharply to the north.  There is an 
impression of another spiral arm attached on the west side of the galaxy and sweeping towards 
the south in a clockwise orientation, though this structure is not as well defined.  A string of five 
stars angling SSE to NNW appear to puncture the galaxy on the south side with the northern two 
stars superimposed on the west side of the galaxy with the last star in the chain just west of the 
nucleus.  Located in a star field densely peppered with stars.

This number is from Bigourdan who originally throught he had found a nova. In the IC 2 notes, 
Bigourdan equates his N5648 with N5649.  Since WH discovered N5649 (III 645), his prior 
number should apply. This galaxy is identified in RNGC, UGC, MCG and RC3 as N5649.  See 
WSQJ July, 1991.  In his description for N5649, Reinmuth writes N5648 np 1.1' but the DSS

Discovered by Swift on 19 Apr 1887 (list VI).  His offset is 7 tsec W and 0.5' N of N5652 = II

to be a single star at GSC position 14 30 53.2 +05 58 58.  The offset from N5652 is 8 tsec W and

NW.  This galaxy is identified as N5649 in all modern catalogues!

Discovered by JH (h1827) and described as "the sf of 2 [with III 645 = N5649]; the faintest 
perceivable."  His position is 9 tsec E and 4' S of U09333, athough his coordinates are given as 
uncertain. Bigourdan's corrected the declination (IC 2 notes).  This galaxy is incorrectly 
identified as N5649 in the RNGC, UGC, MCG, RC3 and DSFG.  The correct identification was 
given by Alister Ling and Malcolm Thomson although it was originally noticed by Reinmuth. 
The galaxy identified as N5655 in RNGC is an anonymous galaxy to the NE of N5655.  Also see

borderline detection was repeated several times knowing precise location.

According to Corwin, the sketch on 16 April 1855 by Rosse establishes the identifications in this 
very tight group.  This galaxy is incorrectly identified in RNGC as N5722.  The CGCG errs in 
identifying N5721 + N5723 as the double system instead of N5721 (M+08-27-013 = CGCG 248-
016nw) + N5722 (M+08-27-014 = CGCG 248-016se). Finally the MCG dec is in error as M+08-
27-013 (the furthest W of the quartet) is placed 2' S of N5722 = M+08-27-014 instead of 30" N.  
This error is carried forward into PGC.

perfectly on line with this galaxy.  Brightest in a tight grouping with N5721 just 35" NNW and 
N5723 1.5' NNE.

Discovered by JH (h1865) and described correctly as "the third of 3 in a line".   His declination is 
2.8' N of M+08-27-014 = CGCG 248-016 (SE component).  Observed at Birr Castle (see sketch 
of 16 April 1855) and three additional companions were picked up (N5721, N5723, N5724).

This galaxy is incorrectly identified in the RNGC as N5723.  The MCG (+08-27-014) dec is 1' 
too far N placing this galaxy north of N5721 instead of S.  It is also possible that this galaxy is 
misidentified in MCG.  See Catalogue and CGCG Corrections by Thomson and NGCBUGS.

17.5" (6/27/98): this galaxy is the last of five viewed in the N5721 group and part of small 
quartet (3 seen).  Like N5721, this marginal object required concentration and averted vision  to 
momentarily glimpse a 16th magnitude stellar object (only core viewed) 1.5' NNE of N5722.  
17th magnitude N5724 just 43" NE was not visible.

Discovered at Birr Castle in a tight quartet which has several catalogue confusions!  Not found 
by Bigourdan. There are identification problems in RNGC, CGCG  and possibly MCG.  See 
Catalogue Correction, Thomson and NGCBUGS.

(R)N5723 apparently refers to N5721. The MCG entry for N5723 (M+08-27-015) may be 
correct or possibly refers to an anonymous galaxy = (R)N5724 at GSC position 14 39 08.4 +46 
44 49 (2000) which is NE of the quartet. CGCG lists the double galaxy as N5721 + N5723

Discovered by Swift and placed at 14h 53.2m +11° 55' (1950).  Bigourdan more accurately 
measured the position at 14h 53.55m +12° 05' (1950) so Swift was off in RA and Dec.  At 
Bigourdan's position is U09602 = M+02-38-022 located at 14h 53.5 +12° 04'.  Further cementing 
this identification is Swift's description of a "* nr sf" which matches U09602.

The RNGC, CGCG, MCG, PGC and NED identify N5782 = M+02-38-021 = CGCG 076-094 
located at 14h 52.6m +11° 54' (1950).  This much fainter galaxy may have been chosen by these 
catalogues as it differs only in RA from Swift's original position, although this ignores 
Bigourdan's correction and Swift's description.  So, the RNGC coordinates should be changed to 
14h 54.7m +11° 58' (1975) and the data revised to described U09602 which is a much better 
match.  U09602 is not identified as N5782 in the RC3.  Listed in RNGC Corrections #6.  See

Discovered by Swift (VI) and described as the south-following of a pair with N5785 (~30 tsec E 
and 2' S).  Assuming N5785 is a duplicate of N5783 (communicated directly to Dreyer), there is 
no galaxy to the SE matching Swift's description.  There is a galaxy M+09-24-049 = CGCG 273-
032 = NPM1G +52.0224 to the SW of N5783 (12 tsec W and 2' S) which is identified as N5788 
in RNGC.  If Swift mixed-up his orientation, then this galaxy is a plausible candidate for N5788 
and Corwin takes this position.  M+09-24-049 = CGCG 273-032 is not identified as N5788 in

18" (6/13/07): fairly bright, fairly large, very elongated 3:1 ~E-W.  The major axis extended to 
~3' in poor seeing.  Contains a bright core and much fainter extensions that dim towards the tips.  
A mag 10 star close NW of the core detracts from viewing.

17.5" (6/12/99): moderately bright, fairly large, broad concentration with a quasi-stellar nucleus 
at moments with direct vision.  A mag 10 star close WNW of the core detracts from viewing.  
Initially appeared ~2.5'x1.5', but with averted vision, very low surface brightness extensions 
oriented E-W increase the dimensions to at least 4'x1.5'.  The ends of the arms fade into the 
background so it was difficult to judge the size.

8" (6/30/84): faint, elongated 5:2 ~E-W, very diffuse, even surface brightness.  A mag 10 star is

Appears very large, fairly rich, with the main body extended ~WNW-ESE and with dimensions  
~40'x25' with roughly 150 stars resolved.  The stars are fairly uniform in brightness (many mag 
11 and 12) and convincingly arranged in loops and chains surrounded by voids.  The outline is 
quite irregular but well defined by the star chains around the periphery.  One chain detaches from 
the main group near the center and heads south and the outline tapers at the following end.  Easy 
in 10x30 IS binoculars, 7° NE of Alpha Centauri.

8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): roughly 60 stars mag 9-12 resolved at 63x.  Very large, 40' 
diameter, almost fills the low power field, elongated ~NW-SE.  Spread out with no central 
condensation.  Many stars have similar magnitudes.  The stars forming the borders are arranged 
in rows and arcs with many empty gaps inside this outline.  There is an extension of stars to the 
south.

18" (7/5/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this is a rich, fairly impressive cluster using the 
27 Panoptic (76x) with at least 80 stars resolved in a 9'x7' area including numerous 11-13th 
magnitude stars.  A number of stars are bunched towards the center.  The periphery is well 
defined by curving sprays of stars roughly forming a heart-shape.  Two 10th magnitude stars 
mark the NW and SW corners of the cluster.  Perhaps 100-120 stars are resolved at 228x with a 
number of stars in pairs, trios, small groups, strings and arcs forming a very pretty cluster.

18" (7/10/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): excellent view of this interesting object at 128x 
with a UHC filter.  Using this combination, the planetary appeared moderately bright and large 
with an irregular shape and surface brightness but elongated WSW-ENE, ~0.9'x0.7'.  At 228x, 
the NE end is brighter and larger and the center seems pinched in, particularly on the N side with 
a small, faint extension or knot on the SW end.  Unfiltered at 228x, a fairly close double (B 832 
= 9/10.5 at 5") lies 3' NE and a very close, faint double lies 1.3' SE of center.  Located 3° ENE of 
mag 3.2 Alpha Circini.

18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this fairly bright, moderately large planetary was 
quite interesting at 171x and a UHC filter.  It was elongated 3:2 E-W, ~55"x40".  It appeared 
brighter on the following end with an indentation or notch on the north side giving the 
impression of a bipolar structure.  Set in a rich Triangulum Australe star field 3' SW of a mag 9 
double star (9/10.5 at 6").  Also a mag 10.5 star lies 2.5' E.

This object is listed in the PK and ESO-Strausberg catalogues as He 2-119 instead of N5844 
although John Herschel's position (from two observations) matches this planetary.  Also, it was 
listed as an unverified southern object in the RNGC and probably because of this error was not 
included in Sky Atlas 2000.0, Sky Catalogue 2000.0 or the first edition of the Uranometria 2000!

This object is listed in the PK and ESO-Strausberg catalogues as He 2-119.  The NGC position is 
a perfect match with this planetary although the identification and was only made recently (read 
in WSQJ).  Listed as an unverified southern object in the RNGC and not included in Sky Atlas 
2000.0 and Sky Catalogue 2000.0 and Uranometria 2000.0!

Described by D.S. as "Three very faint nebulae only" in the IC 2 notes although JH had 2 
observations of pB.  Listed as a planetary in ESO.

Jenni Kay (12.5" f/5): 105X: Obvious - relatively faint, large, round hazy glow. Positive 
response to the UHC filter. 150X: Impressive - relatively bright, elongated E-W, 50" x 40" in 
size, smooth glow throughout. There is a neat double star (B 832) 3.0' to the NE, an unequal pair 
of 9/11 mag. showing colours of golden yellow + mauve, with a separation of 4.8".

David Frew: NGC 5844 is a relatively unknown object that hides in many catalogues under the 
designation Henize 2-119, yet is visible through a 20 cm telescope in good conditions, appearing 
as a fairly faint oval patch of haze about 70´´ x 50´´ in size with no visible central star.  Most 
commercial nebula filters (except the H-Beta filter) give definite improvement on this object.

See observing notes for N5868.  The galaxy described as N5865 in the RNGC is actually N5869.

Discovered by WH (II 684).  Observed in the same sweep as II 545 = N5869.  It is likely that II 
684 refers to d'Arrest's N5868 although both objects were probably accidently given identical 
descriptions (pB) by H.  See Dreyer's Scientific Papers of WH, 1912.  If N5865 is a duplicate of 
N5868, then WH's number could apply by historical precedence.  See NGCBUGS.

The data for N5865 in RNGC applies to N5869 and the U2000 labels N5869 as N5865.  The 
UGC entry (U09742) for N5865 = N5869 should read N5869.

18" (7/13/07): after a couple of failed attempts I picked up this extremely faint companion 
located 2' S of center to N5866 and 1' SE of a mag 12 star.  I first took a look in Alvin Huey's 
22" to check the relative position and appearance. Then in my Starmaster at 262x I glimpsed an 
extremely faint, barely non-stellar knot, ~6" diameter, that required averted and was only visible 
for moments at a time.  The observation was repeatable, though, and confirmed.

This galaxy was discovered by Lord Rosse and observed on two occasions (out of 12) close 
south of N5866. This extremely faint galaxy lies 2' S of N5866, exactly at the relative position 
shown on the Rosse sketch with respect to the galaxy and nearby field stars.  Described in the 25 
April 1851 observation as "alpha [sketch] is an eeF neb" and on 4/13/55, "the nova alpha seems 
to a real neb".

It was not found by Bigourdan and Reinmuth misidentifies N5867 as a mag 14.5 star 3.8' SSE of 
N5866.  N5867 is listed as nonexistent in RNGC as the appearance is virtually stellar on the 
POSS and not equated with N5867 in LEDA (PGC 2512461).  See Corwin's NGCBUGS.

uncertain (poor position from WH) and this galaxy is identified as IC 1100 (from Swift) in UGC,

Discovered by WH (II 818).  In Scientific Papers of WH, Dreyer notes that the listed RA in GC

N5881.  Dreyer's correction places N5881 at roughly 15 07.2 +62° 56.5' (2000).  Less than 1

18" (7/11/07): this low surface brightness globular was easily picked up 12.5x in the 80mm 
finder as a small, faint, hazy knot.  Excellent view at 225x in the 18" which showed 60-70 stars 
with a very weak concentration and no distinct core.  At 325x, 90-100 stars were resolved over 
an 11' diameter though the halo does not have a well defined edge so the count is somewhat 
arbitrary.  The hazy background glow of unresolved star is quite lively and irregular in surface 
brightness.

18" (7/4/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 128x, this fairly bright globular is fairly large, 
roundish, ~6' diameter.  Broadly concentrated to a 3' core which brightens slightly to the center.  
Within the halo and scattered just outside the periphery of the ragged halo are two dozen faint 
stars, though it was difficult to clearly distinguish these outliers from the uniformly rich star field 
which surrounds the globular.  At 228x, at least three dozen mag 14-15.5 stars are resolved and 
the core is very lively and granulated with the strong impression that it was on the verge of more 
extensive resolution.  A mag 10 star lies 4.5' due south of center with a mag 11 star 3' NW.  The 
halo extends to nearly the line connecting these two stars. Forms a pair with globular N5946 just 
over a degree following within Norma.

MCG +01-40-002 = HCG 76d and N5942 1.8' SSW.  This galaxy is not identified as N5941 in 
any modern catalogue.

Discovered by Swift on 19 April 1887 along with N5940, N5942 and N5944. This galaxy is not 
identified with an NGC number in any modern catalogue but visually appears to be the most 
prominent in the group!  Based on correspondence with Corwin, he confirmed my suggestion 
that this galaxy (MCG +01-40-003 = CGCG 050-011e = NPM1G +07.0388 = HCG 76b) may be 
N5941.  Bigourdan also gave this identification.  See NGCBUGS for a complete summary of the

17.5" (7/7/94): very faint, very small, round, 20" diameter, stellar nucleus at moments.  A mag 
14.5 star is off the NW side 45" from center.  This is the third brightest of four in HCG 76 with 
MCG +01-40-002 = HCG 76d 2.0' SE, N5944 2.7' E and N5941 1.8' NNE.

Discovered by Swift in a compact group. This galaxy is identified as N5941 in RNGC, CGCG, 
MCG, RC3, U2000 and DSFG!  These catalogues identify N5942 as Hickson 76d which is likely 
an anonymous galaxy (not found by Bigourdan).

Based on my visual observation of the four members in the group I suggested to Corwin that the 
identification of N5941 was in error which led to his reassignment of identifications based on 
Bigourdan who only observed the 3 brightest galaxies (Hickson 76a/b/c). Bigourdan stated that 
the orientations of N5941/5942 were nf/sp which places N5941 slightly east of N5942.  See

view including a mag 14.5 star off the N edge and a mag 15 star (double on DSS) is within the S 
side of the halo.

Discovered by JH (h1929).  His unusual description reads: "vF, vL, R, vgbM, r, diam = 9s of 
time.  With long attention it is seen to be composed of excessively minute stars like points 
rubbed out; and is in fact a globular cluster, but to see it thus requires long and perfect tranquility 
of the eye.  A very interesting object."  NGC position (from d'A) is an exact match with U09935 
= M+01-40-008.

Swift's IC 4551 (List XII) is probably identical, although Swift's RA was only given roughly to a 
tmin and is about 3 tmin too small.

18" (8/3/05): at 257x, the brightest component of Seyfert's Sextet appeared faint, very small, 
slightly elongated ~E-W, 15"x10", contains a faint stellar nucleus with direct vision.  A mag 14.5 
star lies 1' ESE and two additional mag 14.5 stars lie close SE.  Just resolved from HCG 79C 
which lies 22" west of center.

18" (6/20/04): at 320x, a trio of galaxies forming a small equilateral triangle were fairly easily 
resolved with careful viewing.  The brightest of the trio (HCG 79b) is at the NE corner and 
appeared elongated 3:2 E-W, ~20"x13".  The other two members (HCG 79a and HCG 79c) are 
both extremely small, round, ~10" diameter.  Two mag 14.5 stars 1'-1.5' SE are collinear with 
HCG 79b and a slightly brighter mag 14 star lies 2' W.  In a 30" Starmaster, HCG 79e was barely 
visible (appeared stellar).

17.5" (5/14/88): faint, small, elongated ~E-W.

17.5" (6/6/86): this is Seyfert's Sextet = HCG 79, an extremely compact group!  On close 
inspection, the confused "clump" resolves into three components with the brightest component 
(HCG 79b) appearing fairly faint, small.  Extremely close are HCG 79a = N6027A just 36" SSW 
and HCG 79c = N6027B 22" W of center.  A mag 14.5 star is 1.1' ESE and other faint stars are 
near.  These three galaxies are just resolved at 220x.

13" (6/18/85): slightly elongated E-W.

13" (5/26/84): faint, very small, irregularly round, weak concentration.

Seyfert's Sextet was discovered by Edouard Stephan (XII) in 1882.  Seyfert's name was attached 
after a paper in 1951.  Although Stephan recorded this ultra-compact group as only a single 
object, the description "eF, vF* inv, 2 vF st nr" implies he resolved two or probably three 
member.

The GSC position (15 59 12.5 +20 45 49) refers to HCG 79b (most prominent visually). The 
RNGC does not follow Seyfert's original designations for the members of the group.

See observing notes for N6042.  Possibly =*, HC.  Incorrect identification in the RNGC;

Discovered by Swift (IV).  Described as "eeeF, vS, R, sp of 3 in a line, the other 2 being 2 of 
Stephan's, 3rd of 10."  This object is the first listed, though.  Discussed by Dreyer in the NGC 
notes section.

This number is applied in RNGC and PGC errata list to N6040B which is attached to the SW end 
of N6040.  See RNGC Corrections #1 and P.A.S.P. Vol 83, p320.  The PGC errata lists gives 
N6039 = M+03-41-073 (from MCG).

But Harold Corwin claims NGC 6039 is likely NGC 6042 and Swift's description "sp of 3," 
should read "sf of 3."  See NGCBUGS.

equates NGC 6057 = NGC 6053 -- Swift found the brightest of the two objects near this place 
(the other is NGC 6055) on 6 June 1886.  Two nights later, he found both objects, but apparently 
thought both were new discoveries.  See NGCBUGS for more on the story.

22" (6/28/06 - Hawaii): this stunning cluster was partially resolved in my 15x50 IS binoculars.  
At 110x a few hundred stars were resolved and formed a gorgeous group.  A striking 11" pair 
(h4835) is in the center with the western star a noticeable orange color.  Just south of the eastern 
star is a fainter, third close companion and several other pairs are in the vicinity.  The cluster is 
compressed in the center with a number of curving chains and loops of stars that appear to spiral 
out into the periphery.  Located 25' N of mag 5 Kappa Normae.

18" (7/6/05 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): at 76x (27 Panoptic), this cluster was a stunning 
sight with a few hundred stars sparkling in a 20' region.  Appears comparable to one the richer 
Messier clusters.  The cluster is compressed towards the center and thins out in the periphery, 
blending in with the rich, surrounding Milky Way.  The cluster includes a few striking pairs 
including a bright mag 8.8/9.4 pair at 10" near in the center that is collinear with a much closer 
and fainter equal mag pair.  At 228x, the cluster appear much more irregular and most of the 
stars seem to be arranged in elegant loops and chains that enclose starless holes in the cluster.

8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): At 83x, in excess of 100 stars mag 8-12 in a 20' diameter.  Very 
bright, large, very rich, compressed towards the core which includes a striking double star at 
center (h4835 = 8.8/9.4 at 10").  Many stars arranged in spirals and arcs, rich in faint stars.  The 
brightest mag 7.8 star is located at the south edge with a mag 8 star off the E edge.  This is a 
beautiful open cluster in the rich Norma starcloud!

NW of a mag 9.5 star.  Collinear with a faint double star 3' S (13/14.5 at 18").  Incorrect 
identification in the RNGC and plotted incorrectly on the U2000.

The NGC coordinates (obtained by Dreyer from Lewis Swift in private correspondence) are 16 
14 25 +62 21 20 (2000).  This object was never formally entered in any of Swift's discovery lists 
prior to the NGC.  However, in Swift's list IX in Astronomische Nachrichten 3004, he published 
a corrected position for N6111 (object #57) at 16 14 16 +63 16.2 (2000).  This position 
corresponds with CGCG 320-014 = M+11-20-007 at 16 14 22.5 +63 15 40 (2000).  His 
description "D* nr s points to it" clinches the identification as this galaxy is collinear with a faint 
double star 3' S (mag 13/14.5 at 18"). This galaxy is not identified as N6111 in MCG (M+11-20-
007) or CGCG (320-014) and is misplotted on U2000.  See Addenda sheet to Catalogue 
Corrections, Thomson and RNGC Corrections #5.

Bigourdan measured what he thought might be N6111 at 16 15 29 +62 44 (2000), which is given 
in the IC 2 notes section but Malcolm Thomson measured Bigourdan's offsets carefully and 
arrived at a close double star.

RNGC misidentifies N6111with IC 1210 at 16 14 30.8 +62 32 15 (2000).  Coincidentally, Swift 
also discovered IC 1210 and it is placed correctly in List IX.  So the position of N6111 should be 
changed to 16h 14.1m +63 19 (1975) and the data changed to describe CGCG 320-014 = M+11-
20-007.

See observing notes for N6363.  Incorrect identification in the RNGC.

Discovered by Stephan (II) in 187.  His position is roughly 25' W of N6145 within Abell 2197 
and there are only faint stars near this position.  RNGC identifies N6138 with the edge-on galaxy 
MCG +07-34-020, located 7' N of N6145.  Due to the large positional discrepancy with 
Stephan's generally very accurate position, N6138 should be reclassified as nonexistent.  None of 
the other modern catalogues have a listing for N6138.  See RNGC Corrections #2.

Update: According to Corwin, Stephan misidentified his comparison star and N6138 = N6363.

<25% of time with averted vision.  Faintest of trio and situated 1.4' SE of N6145 and 2' NW of 
N6146 in AGC 2197.  Incorrect identification in the RNGC.

The Birr Castle observers examined the N6146 field three times (with no specific measurements) 
but the sketch from 26 May 1849 shows three galaxies on a line with comments: "2 new neb, 
alpha eF st, beta S."  Dreyer apparently later added the parenthetical comment "Query h1957 and 
h1958 and one Nova."

Assuming the direction of drift is down (west), then the sketch shows h1957 = N6145 (beta) and 
h1958 = N6146 (unlabelled) and the third galaxy (alpha in sketch = GC 4196 = N6147) is either 
MCG +07-34-022 or MCG +07-34-023.  But MCG does not identify either of these faint 
galaxies as N6147 and both MCG galaxies are missing from CGCG.  Also, MCG +07-34-023 is 
mentioned as a companion to N6146 in the UGC notes at 2.3', PA = 338d, 0.45x0.40 but again 
without a NGC designation.

Based on RNGC positions, it appears that (R)N6147 = MCG +07-34-022 and (R)N6141 = MCG 
+07-34-023.  The latter ID is clearly incorrect as Bigourdan's position for N6141 is over 20' 
southwest, although it also used in the PGC.

After two previous failures on N6147, I was successful on 7/24/95 although this galaxy was a 
marginal glow, about 15" diameter and visible <25% of time with averted vision.  On 7/29/08 
this galaxy was easier and visible continuously with averted.  The position was nearly on a line 
between N6145 and N6146. So I'd suggest N6147 = MCG +07-34-023 although I'm not aware of 
any modern catalogue that makes this match.  There was no indication of MCG +07-34-022 less 
than 1' southwest which appears smaller and fainter on DSS.

Looking again at the Rosse sketch, there is a faint star (also labelled as alpha) which is placed 
below (preceding) N6147.  This position corresponds with M+07-34-022, so it very possible that 
this galaxy was seen as stellar and did not receive a NGC number.

with a fainter glow and the entire object forms a slightly elongated, 6.2'x5.2' oval.  The nebula is

18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): this bipolar emission nebula was a startling sight 
at 171x and UHC filter!  A bright illuminating star (HD 148937 at V = 6.8) is surrounded by two 
lobes or loops to the NW (N6164) and SE (N6165).  Both loops contain brighter arcs 
symmetrically placed at the opposite ends.  This is a large object, ~6' diameter, with the SE knot 
a bit brighter.  A mag 9 star is 3' NE, outside the nebulosity.  Located near the midpoint of mag 
4.5 Epsilon Normae 1.3° NW and N6188/6193 a similar distance SE.

John Herschel listed the NW and SE components separately (h3632 and H3634) so it received 
two NGC numbers (6164 and 6165).  This emission object is erroneously listed as a planetary 
nebula (PK 336-0.1) in several older sources, including the RNGC.  The illuminating star is a 
massive, evolved O-star, losing mass from its outer layers through a strong stellar wind  (similar 
mechanism to the Crescent and Thor's Helmet).

M+00-42-003 at 16 22 10.3 -01 30 54 (2000).  IC 1213 was discovered by Swift and his position 
is close enough (9 tsec preceding) to pin down his identification.

Because of the error in list XIII the RNGC lists N6172 as nonexistent and U10352 is identified 
IC 1213 in UGC, MCG and CGCG, although RC 3 lists this galaxy as N6172.   Discussed in 
my RNGC Corrections #6 and NGCBUGS.

18" (7/10/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): With the 27mm Panoptic at 76x and UHC 
filter, this is an amazing region of bright and dark nebulosity involving oc N6193 and extending 
throughout the entire 51' field in a N-S orientation. The bright nebulosity is split into two large 
sections by a dark lane which runs N-S.  The eastern portion is the most prominent and includes 
the scattered cluster N6193 and its three brighter stars (5.6/6.8/7).  On the southern end of this 
section the nebulosity tapers down towards the SW corner, 15'-20' from the core of the cluster.  
The western rim of the nebula is sharply defined with a locally brighter, crisp edge delineated by 
the dark river which meanders N-S throughout the field.  The eastern and northern ends fade into 
the rich Milky Way background field.

A nearly perfect ellipse of moderately bright stars is just SW of the main body of the cluster and 
beyond the edge of nebulosity into the rift.  The center of this ring is within the highest contrast 
portion of the dark rift although the eastern side of the ring intersects the bright edge.  This 
15'x10' loop of stars spans the two sections of nebulosity.

The western portion of the nebulosity extends mostly NW of the elliptical ring and is clearly 
fainter.  The highest contrast is along its eastern rim and runs N-S, roughly parallel to its brighter 
counterpart on the east side of the rift.  The nebulosity fades towards the north and west with no 
well-defined edge but again is quite extensive.  The catalogued dimensions of 20'x12' are too 
small and cover only the brightest portion of this much more extension HII/dark nebula complex.

8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): very large faint nebulosity which envelops open cluster N6193, 
about 20' diameter.  Extends roughly E-W through the cluster but also a very long brighter streak 
oriented N-S extends mainly to the south on the west side of cluster.  This streak is well defined 
with an abrupt edge but there is no contrast gain with a UHC filter.

8" (7/16/82): faint, moderately large, low surface brightness glow on the W side of open cluster 
N6193.  Very far south for observing from Northern California.

couple of very faint mag 15 companions to the bright double.  The three bright stars are encased 
in nebulous halos which respond to UHC filters.  The cluster itself is scattered with no central 
concentration and includes a mixture of mostly bright and some very faint stars.  A perfect 
ellipse of moderately bright stars is just SW of the main portion of the cluster.  Interestingly, the 
center of this ring is mostly free of the nebulosity that permeates the field (see N6188 for 
description) .

nebulosity is involved (see N6188).

group off the SE edge (this is a separate cluster Hogg 22).

8" (7/16/82): only a few faint stars are visible over unresolved haze but appears to be rich.  This

17.5" (7/9/94): several hundred stars in a 10'-12' diameter with a bright central core of 6' 
diameter.  Many stars are arranged in strings and loops including a distinctive streamer attached 
on the SE side which heads south and curves west forming a semicircle and another string is 
attached on the west side of the core and precedes the cluster.  Several chains of stars are also 
resolved over the 6' core.  Running along the north edge of the core is a starless strip or a long 
dark lane which separates the central region from the northern outer halo members.  A dark 
"lane" protrudes into the core on the SE side - this is one of three dark lanes that converge 
forming a "Y" and referred to as the "Propellor" (first described by Lord Rosse).  N6207 lies 28' 
NE and extremely faint IC 4617 lies 14' NNE.

8": very bright, very large, round, highly resolved into several hundred stars mag 11.5-13.5 over 
the entire disc.  Includes several star chains and streamers.  Fairly easy naked-eye in a dark sky.

18" (9/3/08): this barred spiral displays subtle spiral structure and is a fascinating object.  At 
280x, the main portion appears to be a large central bar, 1.5'x1.0', oriented NNW-SSE.  The bar 
is punctuated by an unusually bright stellar nucleus or a superimposed star at the center.  An 
extremely faint star is close SSE along the central star.  Off the N end of the bar is a faint 
appendage or arm is attached that gently curves to the SE and increases the overall dimensions to 
2'x1.5' .  Off the SSE end of the bar, some very weak haze extends to the southwest (beginning 
of an arm).

Contains a bright stellar nucleus or a star is superimposed at the center of the core.  A very faint 
star is just off the NW edge.  At the NW end a faint spiral arm is attached to the main body, 
winding north and then trailing back nearly halfway along the NE flank (this increases the 
dimensions to ~2.5'x2.0').  With concentration a dark gap is visible between the arm and the 
main body (bar) of the galaxy.  A very short extension is strongly suggested at the SE end, 
bending towards the west.  All of these features were sketched and later verified on the DSS.

either darker or an indentation on one side (this is probably a gap between the spiral arms).

18" (7/11/07): at 325x this globular nearly fills the field and extends roughly 11' in diameter.  
Contains a very bright 3.5'x2.5' oval core, extended WNW-ESE.  A mag 10 star with an orange 
tint is just south of the core, 2' from the center.  Two other mag 10-11 stars lie 4' N and 5' ENE 
of center in the halo.  The core is plastered with an immense number of mag 12.5-13.5 stars and 
in the central 2' is an incredibly dense mat of mag 13.5 and fainter stars. Very irregular sprays of 
stars emanate from the central region and form part of the very scraggly outer halo.

17.5" (7/15/99): at 220x this bright cluster is highly resolved over the entire disc.  Appears 
smaller than M10, perhaps 11'-12' diameter with a fairly well-defined 3.5' core.  Two bright field 
stars are embedded in the north edge of the halo and a third bright star is off the following end.  
A mag 10 star is also superimposed just off the SE edge of the core.  A number of brighter 
resolved mag 12 stars appear to be grouped into pairs and trios.  There are a couple of hundred 
fainter stars in the central 8' over unresolved haze.  The outline is very irregular and there are 
distinctive star-poor areas in the outer halo.

13.1" (6/19/82) : bright, large, round, very intense core with faint stars scattered over the core.  
The outer halo is highly resolved into scores of stars.  Slightly inferior to M10 in faint stars.

brighter stars in the outer halo.

Discovered by JH (h3650) and observed on sweep 455.  h's position is 1.4 tmin E of N6216 
(observed 3 times on different sweeps).  His descriptions appear to describe the same object.  
RNGC identifies this object as N6222, Lynga as N6216 and ESO as N6216 = N6222.

From Corwin: NGC 6216 = NGC 6222.  JH recorded the cluster on four different sweeps.  On 
three of those (NGC 6216), his RA is accurate.  However, the fourth sweep (NGC 6222) has the 
RA 1 min 20 sec following; the Dec is the same.  The description for N6222 fits N6216, and 
there is only a Milky Way star field at N6222's position.  The identification, adopted in RNGC 
and ESO, is pretty sure.

12/13 stars from edge to edge (too numerous to count) with the stars very densely packed over 
the core.  A second layer of mag 13/14 stars is superimposed over the core.  The halo contains a

Discovered by Marth (m328) and later measured by Stephan.  His micrometric position clearly 
identifies N6276 = M+04-40-010 = CGCG 139-028, although the RNGC incorrectly identifies 
N6276 with the faint anonymous galaxy U10650.  Bigourdan later reobserved this galaxy and 
initially thought it was a nova, so it also received the designation IC 1239.

This galaxy is incorrectly identified as N6277 in CGCG (139-028) and RNGC.  It is listed as 
N6276 = N6277 in UGC notes.  The MCG incorrectly equates N6276 = N6277.  The 
identification are discussed in more detail in several sources: WSQJ #87, Catalogue Corrections,

Discovered by Swift (II).  On a separate evening he recorded N6298 which may be the same 
object.  Swift's RA was 19 tsec too small but his comment "between 2 stars" pins down the 
identification.  Bigourdan's corrected RA in the IC 2 notes is a perfect match.

See observing notes for N6298.  Incorrect identification (and RA typo) in the RNGC.

The entries for N6297 and N6298 are from Swift on 8 July 1885 and 1 Aug 1885 (list II) as a 
close pair located between two stars with an orientation of SW-NE.  Swift's RA for N6297 was 
20 tsec too small, but Bigourdan observed and corrected the RA so the identification is clear.  
This galaxy (U10690) is situated between a mag 12 star 1.8' ESE and a mag 13 star 0.9' WNW 
and is located at 17 03 36.6  +62 01 33 (2000).

Bigourdan failed to find N6298 and examination of the POSS reveals there is only a single 
galaxy between the two stars mentioned by Swift.  RNGC incorrectly identifies N6298 as a 
member of an extremely faint triple group located 48 tsec of RA following N6297 while Swift's 
position is just 5 tsec following.  Furthermore, the RNGC has a typo for the RA listing 11h 
instead of 17h.  Either N6298 is nonexistent or Swift was confused and recorded the same object 
(also Corwin's conclusion) on the two separate evenings. Listed in RNGC Corrections #3, 
Thomson's Catalogue Corrections and NGCBUGS.

"core" of only 10"-12" in diameter that brightens slightly to the center and is encased in a larger, 
fainter envelope.  Extending from the central core are two remarkable wings oriented WSW-
ENE.  The following wing is much shorter but slightly brighter and this extension abruptly 
shoots towards the SE near the end.  The much longer preceding wing heads WSW and is cut by 
a darker lane that detaches the western tip.

17.5" (6/30/00): at 280x (unfiltered) the Bug Nebula is a remarkable, high surface brightness 
object, elongated 3:1 WSW-ENE, ~2.0x0.7'.  The intensely bright 10" core appears elongated 
SW-NE and is offset to the east of center. A quasi-stellar nucleus sharpens to a stellar point when 
the seeing steadies (this is not the central star, though).  The western wing is longer and is nearly 
split at the midpoint by a dark slash oriented N-S with a brighter condensation at the west end.  
The shorter eastern wing is more pinched and just past its midpoint there is a kink and it angles 
towards the SE.

eastern extensions bends north following the core.

18" (7/17/07): The "Cat's Paw Nebula" is a fascinating HII complex and molecular cloud with 
several distinct sections. At 73x and OIII or UHC filter, the brightest section is on the SE side 
(N6334 = Gum 62) and consists of a 4'-5' glow extending mostly north of a mag 8.5 star (HD 
156738) at 17 20.9 -36 04 (2000).  Appears weaker on the SW side of the star and slightly 
brighter wrapping around the eastern side of the star.  John Herschel only described this section 
of the entire complex.

A second large section forming the SW component (VdBH 86 = Gum 61) lies 13' to the west and 
consists of a faint, 5' glow involving a 17" pair (HD 319703 at 17 19.8 -36 06).  This piece is 
asymmetric and appears as a broad fan sweeping N to SE from the central stars and is very weak 
or nonexistent to the SW of the stars.

A group of smaller pieces forming the NE component (Gum 64b) is 12'-15' N of the brighter SE 
section.  First is an obvious 2' glow surrounding HD 319702 at 17 20.8 -35 52 (2000).  A small, 
faint knot of nebulosity lies 3' W, no more than 1' in diameter.  This knot is also situated 2' SSE 
of a mag 9.5 star that is free from nebulosity.  But to the NW of this star another few arc minutes 
is a third detached piece of nebulosity, ~2' in diameter (brightest part of Gum 64c).  Very weak 
nebulosity appears to connect the NE (Gum 64b) with the SE (Gum 62) section.

Finally, midway between Gum 64b and Gum 61 a small extremely faint detached glow (Gum 
64a) was glimpsed close SE of a star at 17 20.1 -35 58 (2000).

13.1" (7/5/83): fairly easy nebulosity surrounds mag 8 star with UHC filter and extends 30' N.

star is on the SSW edge of rim.  At 323x, the striking rim appears brighter in a 50-60 degree arc 
centered on the brighter star on the NE side.  The amount of structure was surprising given the 
low altitude at -38.4 declination.

17.5" (6/30/00): very pretty annular planetary at 280x, ~45" and set in a rich star field.  A mag 12

rim appears irregularly lit.

13.1" (5/30/87): at 166x with a UHC filter appears fairly faint, fairly small, roundish.  Slightly

18" (7/16/07): at 115x a faint elongated hazy glow was visible just north of a nice 14" pair of 
mag 11/12 stars.  Adding an OIII filter dramatically improves this HII region and shows a bright, 
elongated nebulosity oriented WSW-ENE, ~5'x2'.  Appears brighter in the middle just north of 
the double star.  A faint star is off the north side, oppositely placed from the double.  At 174x the 
nebula is slightly brighter and clumpy in the middle on the south side and a couple of very small 
slightly brighter knots are occasionally visible.  The group of stars to the south (including the 
double) is catalogued as Pismis 24.  Only the brightest portion of this huge HII complex was 
noticed.  NGC 6357 is located 8' WNW of mag 7 HD 157528 and this star is the northernmost of 
a 27' line of four mag 6-7 stars that extends to the south (nicknamed "Las cuatro Juanitas" in 
Chile).  NGC 6334 (Cat's Paw Nebula) lies two degrees SW.

17.5" (5/30/92): at 82x using an OIII filter, this emission nebula is a bright, distinctive object, 
elongated 3:1 E-W, 4.0'x1.5'.  A close mag 11/12 double star is at the south edge.  The whole 
field appears weakly nebulous and the nebulosity is just very faintly visible without a filter at 
220x.  Excellent contrast gain with the OIII filter!  A group of a dozen faint stars is just south (= 
Pismis 24) including a double star.  This nebula is associated with the Wolf-Rayet star HD 
157504 = WR 93 which is located east of the bright section.

position in the 100x field is an elongated group of a dozen stars in a 8' string oriented NW-SE, 
which is just N of mag 7.5 SAO 185358 and ~15' NW of the NGC position.  There is a second 
mag 7.5 star 6' further NW and perhaps the two bright stars draw attention to this weak grouping

of mag 14 stars 2' S of center, one a similar distance east of center and an addition pair on the SE 
side.  About a dozen stars are visible with careful viewing.  At 280x, the cluster is pretty clumpy

glimpsed with averted vision, many near the threshold of visibility.  The full extent of the cluster 
is difficult to trace but extends beyond the central 4' region.

18" (7/30/08): extremely faint, very small, round, 15" diameter, low even surface brightness.  I 
could just barely hold this galaxy continuously with averted vision once it was identified but it 
took knowing the exact position to initially pick up.  This galaxy is generally identified as 
N6394. Although Swift's description for N6393 is a better match with this galaxy it's possible 
that it is too faint for Swift to have picked up.

17.5" (6/18/88): not found


Swift recorded N6393 and N6394 on 1885, July 7 (list I).  His position for N6393 is an excellent 
match with UGC 10889 which is located 3.8' SE of mag 8 SAO 30431 at 17 30 21.4 +59 38 24 
(2000).  The brighter (northern) galaxy was apparently also recorded by Swift in his list IX 
(object 81).

N6394 was placed 3.5' due N of N6393 but there is no object at this position on the POSS and 
Bigourdan was not able to locate a possible candidate.  In an attempt to select an object for 
N6394, the RNGC indentifies N6394 as MCG +10-25-054, although this faint galaxy is located 
about 7' SSW of N6393 and is not a viable candidate.   Corwin suggests that despite the poor 
positions by Swift his original descriptions (not fully given in the NGC) indicates that N6394 = 
UGC 10889 and N6393 = MCG +10-25-054, although MCG +10-25-054 is quite a faint galaxy 
to be picked up by Swift.

identified as N6393 in catalogues, although Corwin identifies it as N6394 based on Swift's 
description.

Discovered by Swift (I).  His position for N6393 matches UGC 10889 = MCG +10-25-055 and 
that is the identification given in all modern catalogues other than NED.  But Swift's original 
description for N6394 is an excellent match with U10889 while the description for N6393 
matches a much fainter galaxy (MCG +10-25-054) to the south, despite the poor position.  See

10x30 (8/8/04 - Haleakala Crater): picked up while sweeping in IS binoculars close to the SSW

visible naked-eye less than 1 degree NNE of mag 5.3 Pi Arae.

18" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): amazing view of this bright globular at nearly

resolved into hundreds of stars, many surprisingly bright at mag 10-11 and overall noticeably 
brighter than most globulars (1st in ranking of brightest stars).  The globular appears fully 
resolved in the halo and even the blazing core is covered wall-to-wall with stars.  Many stars are 
in small groups, chains, curves, etc.  The concentrated core is ~3.5' diameter and at 228x has a 3-

Visible naked-eye.

20" (7/8/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): I also had a fantastic view in the 20" f/5 at 212x

8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): very bright, very large, 10' diameter, irregularly round.  At least 50 
stars mag 10-12 are resolved at 63x.  Bright intense core 3' diameter with dozens of stars 
superimposed and at edges of core.  Contains a large halo with many faint and brighter stars 
superimposed over a mottled background.  Beautiful globular although observed at only 13° 
elevation from Baja.  This is the nearest globular and first in ranking by brightest stars.

18" (7/21/04): at 92x roughly 200 stars are visible in this beautiful naked-eye cluster.  There are 
four bright mag 6-7 stars in the main group which form a perfect parallelogram with longer sides 
of 7' oriented WSW-ENE and shorter sides of 4' oriented NW-SE.  A string of stars connects the 
two stars on the long southern side of the parallelogram (the star at the SE vertex is orange tinged 
BM Sco) with a nice double star embedded in the string.  The NW vertex is part of a bright 
isosceles triangle with two mag 8-9 stars and ~7' further NW of this star is a small, nice asterism 
consisting of a trio and a double.  Also a wedge-shaped group of 7 stars extends between this 
NW vertex (which also has two additional fainter companions) and the SW vertex (short side of 
parallelogram) Another distinctive string of stars runs through the center of the parallelogram 
roughly parallel to the two long sides.  A nice mag 9/10 double resides along the long northern 
side of the parallelogram.  An additional mag 7 star is the SW of the parallelogram.  Around the 
main group there are numerous scattered stars and the cluster does not have a distinct border.  
Over 70 stars in the cluster are brighter than 11th magnitude.

13.1" (7/5/83): very bright, fairly large.  Includes a curving rows of stars and a close group of 7

Albert Marth's position for N6430  was off by 38 tsec in RA and although his description 
matches, modern catalogues and the U2000 (second edition) identify this galaxy as UGC 10966.  
Karl Reinmuth identified N6430 as a chain of 4 stars and the RNGC followed suit classifying 
N6430 as nonexistent.

Discovered by Marth (m344).  Reinmuth describes a chain of stars - "no mE neb seen; a chain of 
4 st 14-15, 150°, in 17h 38.9m (1860)", but Corwin identifies NGC 6430 as CGCG 112-035.

18" (7/22/06): this fascinating planetary was viewed at 435x.  The overall shape is rectangular 
with the two longer sides oriented NW to SE.  Both ends are noticeably brighter giving an 
annular appearance.  The NW end is slightly brighter and irregular in surface brightness with a 
brighter spot or two.  The rim of the NW end is slightly bowed out and has a well-defined 
boundary edge in the interior.  The rim at the SE end of the planetary is unusually straight and 
well-defined.  With averted vision it appeared to extend slightly beyond the main body of the

the minor axis. 

17.5" (7/14/99): this bright PN is striking at 280x with a great deal of structure evident.  It has a 
boxy appearance, elongated NW-SE with dimensions ~45"x30".  The ends of the major axis are 
clearly brighter with a bright, shallow arc or crescent-shaped curve on the NW end.  This lobe 
has an irregular surface brightness with a couple of brighter spots.  The SE lobe is brighter but 
has an oddly flat edge.  At 380x, the eastern end of the SE lobe is brighter and has a small 
extension or nodule which bulges out beyond the rectangular outline to the east.  The center is 
clearly darker and with careful viewing appears as a dark band running SW-NE.  A mag 12 star

planetary forms an unusual pair with GC N6440 20' SSW.

13" (8/5/83): bright, fairly small, elongated NW-SE, brighter along the NW side.  A darker 
center visible at 288x appears to cut through the minor axis. The NW edge is slightly curved

Discovered by Swift in a group of faint galaxies on 9 June 1886 along with N6456.  His position 
is a fairly good match (just 4 tsec W and 0.4' S) with U10974 = M+11-21-025 = CGCG 321-039

18" (7/21/04): at 92x at least 300 stars are visible in the cluster, though very difficult to count

much larger and brighter (very prominent naked-eye), but it is much more scattered than M6 and 
so is less impressive.  There are several bright, distinctive strings in the cluster including a N-S 
string of ~8 stars on the east side of the central region.  An equilateral triangle of mag 6, 7 and 8 
stars with sides of 3' is on the NW side of the core of the cluster.  A clump of 5 stars is near the

using averted vision and GSC chart of the cluster.  Located 1.6' SE of N6470 = UGC 10974 = 
MCG +11-21-025, the galaxy identified as N6472 in modern catalogues.  A mag 14.5 star is just 
30" due N.  Due to the faintness of the object, the identification as N6477 is very uncertain.

Discovered by Swift (V) on 25 Sept 1886.  This object was described as the 6th of 6 in a faint 
group including NGC 6456, 6463, 6470, 6471, 6472, and 6477.

There are several uncertain or invalid identifications in the RNGC (and other catalogues) 
including N6470, N6471, N6472 and N6477 because of imprecise coordinates and similar 
descriptions ("eeeF, eS, R, eee dif") - implying these galaxies were near Swift's visual threshold. 
The galaxy identified in the RNGC as N6477 is most likely N6472 at 17 44 03.0 +67 37 49 
(2000).  This galaxy is 8 tsec of RA following Swift's position of N6472.

Corwin proposes that Swift's N6477 may be the galaxy at 17 44 30.6 +67 36 40 (2000, 15 tsec of 
RA preceding and 1.5' S of Swift's position (17 44 45 +67 38.1).  This galaxy was an a truly 
marginal object in my 17.5" (see notes) and would not have been picked up without a GSC plot.  
It is also possible that Swift mistook a faint star for this object although it appears that Bigourdan 
also (barely) saw this object (his measured RA is 17 tsec too large). Discussed in my RNGC 
Corrections #3 where I described N6477 as nonexistent.

two dozen mag 13-14.5 stars over an unresolved glow situated in a rich portion of the Milky 
Way. At 220x, this group is ~6' diameter, although it is not very well detached so the borders are 
somewhat arbitrary. As many as 50 stars are now visible as a number of mag 15 and fainter stars 
are resolved.  Some unresolved background haze is still evident. Also noticed at 100x was as a 
smaller circular glowing spot ~8' SW of the previous grouping (see description for Ru 136).

18" (7/11/07):  this very unusual globular that is buried within a small asterism and requires 
careful viewing.  At 325x a very distinctive 1.5' string or shallow arc of stars is oriented E-W and 
contains 6 stars (these are possible cluster members).  Within this shallow arc is a 20" knot just 
east of the midpoint and this is probably the core of the globular.  The entire string is 
superimposed on a rich Milky Way background so it was very difficult to determine a diameter 
for the outer halo.

17.5" (7/10/99): this interesting globular is located nearly midway along a short 1.5' E-W arc of a 
half dozen or so mag 13-14 stars that are bowed out to the north.  The globular is a faint, round, 
40" glow which is embedded just inside the center of this string which extends beyond the 
globular to the west and east.  At 100x, this string, along with the haze of the cluster creates the 
impression the globular is quite elongated.

18" (7/21/04): at 435x, it was fairly clear that there were two shells in the main body which were 
of different sizes and orientations creating a complex appearance. Surrounding the high surface 
brightness main body was a thin, very faint outer envelope (inner portion of the outer envelope). 
The central star was visible continuously.

IC 4677 was easily visible at 160x using a UHC filter as a slightly elongated, low surface 
brightness glow 1.7' W of center of N6543 and 1.5' SE of a mag 11 star which lies 2.7' WNW of 
N6543.  This shock-excited knot in the outer halo was elongated 3:2 SW-NE, roughly 20"x13".  
At 225x it was barely visible unfiltered, but could be held continuously at this power adding a 
UHC filter.

18" (6/21/03): remarkable view at 538x.  The central star shines steadily in the center of what 
appears to be two superimposed shells, offset in orientation by ~90 degrees.  Interior filamentary

17.5" (6/11/88): viewed at 280x and 412x; the Cat's Eye nebula appears very bright, fairly small, 
oval SW-NE, blue-green color.  Appears darker (annular) surrounding the mag 11 central star.  
The prominent visual portion is surrounded by a very faint oval outer envelope (386") which was 
not seen but includes the bright irregular knot IC 4677 1.7' west of center.  N6552 is located 10' 
following.

IC 4677 was suspected at 220x without filtration close to a mag 15 star located 1' W of the 
planetary.  Using a UHC filter, IC 4677 was clearly visible with averted vision as a very faint 
elongated patch, ~25"x15" oriented SW-NE.  Requires averted for a good view but could hold 
steadily almost continuously.  It was also visible at 140x with an OIII filter and 280x with the 
UHC, but 220x provided the best view.

forming the western leg of the triangle being most evident.  A number of faint stars pepper the 
interior at 225x, though at this power the group filled the field and was not recognizable at all.  
This appears to be a random Milky Way asterism although the triangular outline is somewhat 
detached in the field at low power.  Contains a number of mag 10.5-11.5 star although there is no 
single brighter star.  A fairly small triangle of stars including a mag 11 pair at 27" is off the west 
side.

At 220x, ~50 stars are seen with some faint clumps visible but as the group now fills the field I 
would not have noticed it at all at this power.  The outline is easier to trace along the western 
flank and around the NW end.  An evenly matched mag 12 pair is off the west side but is not

18" (7/16/07): at 323x appears as a fairly bright, sharply defined disc, slightly elongated SW-NE 
and perhaps 48"x42".  The disc exhibits a subtle irregularity in surface brightness but there was 
no evident annularity.  A couple of extremely faint stars occasionally sparkled over the disc, 
though it was difficult to tell if one was situated right at the center.

17.5" (6/28/00): at 280x this moderately bright PN appears elongated 5:4 SW-NE, ~50"x40".  
The surface brightness is pretty smooth and no central star was visible.  A UHC filter provides a 
moderate contrast gain.  Set is a rich star field.

13" (8/17/85): observation at 166x and 220x: fairly faint, moderately large, slightly elongated

18" (8/14/07): picked up at 94x as a "bloated" blue star of 11th magnitude.  Easy to verify with a 
UHC blink though only a moderate contrast gain.  Situated in a beautiful star field on the 
southwest side of the Small Sgr Star Cloud.  A very long dark lane (part of B304) crosses the low 
power field from SW to NE, passing to the north of the planetary.  In the 80mm finder at 25x this

18" (8/2/05): at 225x I noticed an interesting color effect; although the color was a quite 
prominent bluish-green, while staring at the center the planetary decreased in size and the color 
changed to a deep emerald green.

Increasing to 435x this compact planetary appears elongated 3:2, ~16"x11" and brightens 
towards the center with direct vision, although the color becomes bluish and washed out.  The 
surface brightness is too high to pick out a central star.  There appears to be small, faint envelope 
which encases the planetary.

18" (7/19/04): at 225x this small planetary is very bright, with an obvious blue-green color.  
Generally, the color appeared a vivid emerald green and other times there was bluish tint to the 
color.  The main body is only ~8" in size with a thin halo elongated ~SW-NE increasing the size 
to roughly 15"x11".  It appears to have a much larger, very low surface brightness halo, though 
perhaps this is scattered light as the planetary has such as a high surface brightness.  This halo is 
still evident at 322x appears ~30" in diameter.

end.  Image confused by these two close faint stars.  A wide pair of stars is 12' SW.  Located in 
the UGC 11156 group and incorrectly identified as UGC 11155 in the RNGC.

Discovered by Stephan (I).  The coordinates of his 8th magnitude offset star are off a bit and 
when this correction is applied (11s of RA and 30" of dec) his micrometric position is 18 12 20.3 
+25 39 40 (2000).  This corresponds almost exactly with MCG +04-43-010 = CGCG 142-021 at 
18 12 18.4 +25 39 44 (2000).  To further pin down this identification, Stephan's description 
mentions "between 2 faint stars" and there is a mag 14 star at the northeast end and a mag 15 star 
at the south end of this galaxy which were recorded in my 17.5" observation. 

Bigourdan also recorded a "nebulous star" near N6581 although his position for IC 1280 is an 
excellent match with N6581.  Because of this match, this galaxy is identified as IC 1280 in 
MCG, CGCG and UGC (notes to U11150) and it seems logical to assume IC 1280 = N6581.  
But according to Malcolm Thomson, Bigourdan mentioned both objects in the same observation 
(could he have mistaken N6581 because of the error in Stephan's position?)

The object identified as N6581 in the RNGC is U11155, which is part of a double system with 
IC 4697 in the UGC 11156 galaxy group and is located 13' S of Stephan's position.

Discovered by JH (h2002) and identical to Swift's N6590 who gave a poor RA (0.7 tmin too far 
W).  See discussion by Barnard in AN 3101.  Corwin also equates N6590 and N6595 but since 
JH earlier discovered N6595 his designation should apply over Swift's N6590.

The nebulosity is identified as N6590/N6595 in the SC2000 and N6595 is actually listed as an 
open cluster at the same position in SC 2000 (from Lynga).  The position given in the RNGC is 
9' S of N6590/6595.    Barnard also mentioned this object again in AN #4239 and it received the 
designation IC 4700, although it appears that he only referred to a BD star, as there is no specific 
position given in the article.  Apparently Dreyer did not make the NGC identification

any rich spots or concentration and the central region is noticeably lacking in stars.  The only 
reason I can see this object may have been recorded by Herschel is it is somewhat detached in a 
low power field.  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.

Discovered by JH (h2005): "A loose straggling cluster of stars 11...12m."  Reinmuth simply 
writes "no Cl"  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC but in Lynga #5 catalogue as OCL-47 = Lund

probably correct. There is really nothing at either position on GSC although 2 tmin W of JH's

Discoverted by Swift (I).  Both MCG and RNGC identify N6609 with the faint edge-on MCG 
+10-26-024 = FGC 2194.  The RNGC declination is identical to N6608 although the new 
description clearly refers to the edge-on 2' S of N6608.  Swift's original position is close 
following N6608 (not south) and this galaxy was missed with my 17.5" so it seems unlikely 
Swift could have picked up this extremely faint edge-on .  Also N6607 was described as "eF" 
and the edge-on would have be more difficult, yet the description reads "vF". Discussed in 
RNGC Corrections #3 and NGCBUGS (Corwin identifies the edge-on as N6608 although he 
questions if Swift could have viewed it).

bordered by mag 5.7 HD 169033 star at the SE vertex, a mag 8 star ~12' NW and a mag 9 star 
~9' W.  This identification is uncertain as the region is completely indistinguishable from 
surrounding fields in star density and does not have any resemblance to a cluster although the 
Milky Way background seems locally brighter (also, JH does not mention the mag 5.7 star). At 
220x, there is a fairly well-defined edge to portions of this Milky Way background and there is a 
small extension to the west near the star at the NW vertex.  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC,

Corwin originally equated Lacaille's N6634 with M69.  This implies a 1° error in the dec of 
N6634 too far south.  But Glen Cozens argues that the globular is fainter than others seen by 
Lacaille and the position is further out than any others seen by him.  At or near his position, 
though, is a small group of 4 stars that may be the intended object.  Corwin now feels this 
interpretation is more likely (see NGCBUGS). Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC but not 
equated with M69.

From HC: NGC 6677 and 6679 = IC 4763.  I think that only Malcolm's objects "A" and "B" 
were seen by Swift, Bigourdan, and Howe.  (Kobold also has an observation of NGC 6677 in the 
Strassburg Annals, Vol. 3, 1909, but his comparison star has a high proper motion which makes 
the derivation of an accurate position more difficult.)  I agree with Malcolm that A must be NGC 
6677, but am convinced that B is NGC 6679 = IC 4763.  Here's why:

1)  As I always do for identification problems, I determined as accurate aposition as I can for 
every object bearing on an identity question.  In this case, this meant reducing Bigourdan's 
micrometric observations, and digging positions out of the Guide Star Catalogue.  Here are the 
results for Malcolm's three objects (positions are for the equinox 1950.0):

                              18 33 33.58  +67 05 44.8   Big
                              18 33 35     +67 05.7      Howe
C        ---               18 33 34.36  +67 06 21.8   GSC

Notice that I have used Bigourdan's observations only from the night of 5 Sept 1891 for NGC 
6677.  His observations on 25 June 1897 refer to the star southeast of the galaxy.  I also suspect 
that his comparison star (BD +66 1115 = GSC 4227-00549) has a relatively large proper motion 
as there is a systematic offset of +0.24 sec and -7.8 arcsec between his positions and the GSC 
positions for all the objects for which he used this star as a comparison. I've corrected his 
positions in the table above for these offsets.

The excellent agreement between Bigourdan's, Howe's, and the GSC positions convinces me that 
the two micrometric observations from each of the early observers do indeed refer to Malcolm's 
objects A and B.  Furthermore, their descriptions also make sense -- and agree with Swift's -- if 
we note one additional fact:  object B is in fact a close double galaxy.  Object C is more than 30 
arcsec north of B, which puts it much too far away to be part of the object that Howe measured 
as NGC 6679:  "This is a nebulous D * of mags 12.5, distance 5 arcsec, [position] angle 60 deg."  
Bigourdan's description of it as a double star, one that he could not resolve at 344X, also points 
to the close pair as the actual NGC 6679 -- and adds support to the evidence from his measured 
position that the pair is equal to Big 333 = IC 4763 (it is, of course, clear that Bigourdan himself 
realized this).

All of this evidence, combined with Swift's own descriptions (in his papers 3 and 9) pin down 
the identifications without doubt.

NGC 6682
18 39 37 -04 48.8

17.5" (8/12/01): this appears to be a large Milky Way field in the Scutum Star Cloud, at the 
eastern edge of the great rift.  At 64x (31 Nagler), there is no obvious cluster but two large, fairly 
rich, elongated condensations were noted.  The larger southern group is about 20' in size, 
extended NW-SE.  Connected on the following end to the north is another Milky Way patch, 
perhaps 15' in size.  Both groups are fairly rich with a background of haze.  The star density 
dramatically drops just east of this cloud (part of Great Rift) and then the Milky Way bursts into 
view again on the opposite side of the rift.  So the grouping only barely stands out due to location 
in an absorption hole at edge of the Great Rift.  Listed as a nonexistent cluster in the RNGC.

Discovered by JH (h2017): "A L p rich cl of straggling stars, having a vacuity in M and broken 
into 2 or 3 clusters."  His RA is 2.0 tmin east of this group (error repeated in NGC and RNGC).

N6685 was discovered by Swift along with NGC 6686 on the same night, the orientation 
described as SW-NE.  Bigourdan later corrected Swift's declination based on his 1888, Aug 2 
observation, but kept Swift's original separation and orientation.  Howe added a third object, IC 
4772,  which he placed 2.7' south of N6685.   The CGCG (228-021), MCG (+07-38-015) and 
UGC (11317) apparently ignored Bigourdan's correction and reversed the identifications of 
N6685 and IC 4772.  The RNGC misidentifies N6685 with IC 4772.  See my RNGC Corrections

fact, the only object in the area that caught my eye was a small glowing 2' knot of stars at ~18

triangular, ~20' diameter with an additional loop of stars bowed out to the south attached at the 
ends of the southern side of the triangle.  At the eastern end is a distinctive 22" pair of mag

V = 8.2;  Size 7.2

18" (7/23/06): situated in a gorgeous low power Milky Way star field at 115x with a dense 
background mat of faint stars filling the 45' field and planetary IC 1295 24' ESE.  At 435x 
roughly three dozen stars are resolved in a 6' region, mostly on the western half of the cluster.  
The core is moderately bright but not sharply concentrated.  The irregular halo is peppered with 
faint stars though at the periphery it was impossible to really distinguish from the numerous faint 
field stars that surround the cluster.  A dark lane is quite obvious on the south side, appearing to 
detach the outer section of the halo on the SE side.  The outer halo is poorly resolved on the 
eastern end.  

18" (8/23/03): at 435x, approximately three dozen stars can be counted, although the eastern 
edge of the halo resists resolution.  A dark lane cuts through the cluster on the south side running 
SW-NE and detaching a small piece of the halo on the SE side and flattening the central blaze 
which begins just north of the lane.  IC 1295 lies 24' ESE and both are nicely framed within the 
field of the 20mm Nagler.

17.5" (6/29/00): at 220x this is a bright, moderately large cluster, ~6' diameter in a very rich 
Milky Way field.  Contains a relatively large, intense 3' core with a number of very faint stars 
peppered over the background glow.  A small, partially resolved piece is detached at the SE end 
by a dark lane.  The surrounding halo includes a number of brighter stars, though it is difficult to 
untangle the maze of stars in the halo from the rich Milky Way background.  Roughly 30 stars 
are resolved at 280x, although it is difficult to accurately count. The core has irregular 
appearance with a flattened side caused by a sharp light cut off on the south side. PN IC 1295 
lies 24' ESE.

17.5" (7/1/89): about two dozen stars resolved over haze.  A very rich clump is visible at the 
west side and a detached clump is at the SE end.  The outline is irregular. 

13" (7/27/84): about 15 stars resolved including several extremely faint stars, very mottled, 
ragged edges, non-symmetric (flattened on the SE side). 

8" (7/24/82): grainy, very lively but only a few stars resolved over haze at high power.  Strong 
impression that in excellent seeing or a bit more aperture would resolve more fully.

18" (7/15/07): at 280x, stands out prominently just 2' S of mag 5 Nu2 Sagittarii.  The globular 
appears as an unconcentrated, low surface brightness hazy glow just 1' in diameter but with 5 
likely field stars superimposed, giving the appearance of a small open cluster over unresolved 
background haze.  At 393x, 4 out of these 5 mag 13 and fainter stars are grouped into two close 
pairs with roughly similar separations and orientations.  One pair is near the center (oriented ~N-
S) and another is at the NE edge oriented NNW-SSE  (catalogued as IC 4802) while the 5th star 
is at the WNW edge.  The glow of the cluster is irregularly round (slightly elongated E-W) and 
has a well-defined edge, unusual for a globular.

18" (7/19/04): at 225x the view is quite unusual as the glow of the globular is just 2' south of 
mag 5 Nu 2 Sag.  The globular is just a fairly faint, round 1' glow with a low surface brightness 
and no evident concentration.  Quite striking, though, are several superimposed stars including a 
close pair of mag 14 stars at the NE edge.  At 434x, a star near the center is also clearly double 
and the halo of the globular has a ragged periphery.

17.5" (7/20/98): very unusual small, faint glow located 2' south of mag 5 Nu 2 Sagitarii!  The 
very faint background glow is ~1' diameter but more notable are several superimposed stars.  A 
close pair of mag 13.5 stars is at the NE edge 25" from center (this is IC 4802!) and a similar star 
is at the WNW edge 20" from center.  There is a very small bright core which on closer 
inspection appears to be a close pair of mag 12.5 stars or possibly a bright stellar core and nearby 
star.  Other than the central "knot", the unconcentrated 1' background patch has a low surface 
brightness and is much smaller than the listed diameter of 4'.

13" (6/18/85): fairly faint, very small.  This globular appears as a hazy patch easily visible just 
1.8' S of Nu 2 = 35 Sagitarii (V = 5.0)!  About half a dozen stars are either superimposed or 
resolved including two close pairs.

18" (6/21/03): I took a look at the Ring Nebula at very high powers  in steady seeing for the first 
time using my Starmaster w/Zambuto optics.  With the 2.5x Powermate, I used 538x, 807x and 
finally 1087x!  At 538x and 807x, the mag 15.7 central star flicked on and off several times, but 
only momentarily.  At 1087x, the central star was visible more consistently, flickering on/off 
regularly and cleanly visible for a few seconds at a stretch.

17.5" (6/5/99): Viewed under very steady seeing at 380x.  The halo is elongated 4:3 WSW-ENE 
and clearly brighter along the north and south sides (minor axis).  The ends of the major axis are 
clearly "thinner" and slightly fainter at the following end. The interior has a pale gauzy 
appearance.  The edge of the ring has a "wooly" appearance with a strong impression of small 
irregular wisps or filaments hinting at the extremely faint outer halo.  The central star popped in 
and out of view a few times.  A mag 13 star is close off the east side and a very faint mag 15.7 
star is a similar distance off the west end.  Another mag 15.6 star is 1' due south of center.  At 
high power a 3" pair of mag 14-15 stars ~1.3' NNW of center are just resolved with a difficult 
mag 16.1 star ~30" further north.  On 8/6/02 I didn't see the mag 16.6 star on the visual sequence 
chart.

17.5" (7/1/89): extremely faint central star visible for moments at 412x just E of center.  The 
central star was held steadily for a few seconds at best with averted vision.  Forms an unusual 
pair with the extremely faint galaxy IC 1296 4' NW.

17.5" (7/1/00): very faint, very low surface brightness globular in a dusty portion of the Aquila 
Milky Way (dimmed by at least 4.5 magnitudes of extinction).  The core is 15"-20" slightly 
brighter spot less than 1' SW of a mag 12 star.  The surrounding halo is just a weak glow with 
averted vision, 2'-2.5' in diameter with an ill-defined edge, and just brighter than the Milky Way 
background.  The glow encompasses the mag 12 star on its northeast side but does not reach two 
mag 13.5 stars off the south side. This cluster would most likely be overlooked if just quickly 
scanning the field and along with N6380 it is one of the two most difficult NGC globulars!

17.5" (7/24/95): very faint, ~3' diameter, unusually low surface brightness for a globular cluster 
with only a very weak central brightening.  A mag 12 star is superimposed on the N side and two 
mag 13.5 stars are at the S end (not members).  The core appears to be located ~1' SW of the 
mag 12 star. Does not appear like a globular but rather a diffuse nebula in a rich Milky Way 
field.  Difficult to determine exact outer extent.

13" (8/11/85): extremely faint, moderately large, very low surface brightness and fades at high 
power.  Near the visual threshold this is one of the two faintest NGC globulars along with 
N6380.  Estimate V = 14.  Located at the NW edge of an elongated group of six mag 12/13 stars 
and 25' ESE of mag 5.8 SAO 124203.  The position listed in the NGC, SC2000, N2000, U2000,

Discovered by JH (h2029). His description "a cluster of loose small stars of various magnitudes; 
fills the field." appears to describe a larger clustering including the globular.  Although listed as a 
GC in the RNGC, the new description quotes Carlson and incorrectly states "no cluster".  Listed 
in Lynga as an open cluster = Berkeley 42.  The position listed in SC2000, NGC, L&S, N2000,

V = 5.5;  Size 20.4

18" (7/10/02 - Magellan Observatory, Australia): NGC 6752 is one of the top globular clusters 
(4th brightest in integrated magnitude and 2nd in terms of brightest members) and was 
spectacular from Magellan Observatory.  At 128x, this naked-eye cluster seemed fully resolved 
with an uncountable number of stars densely packed over a large region.  Streamers in the halo 
greatly increase diameter to roughly 20'.  The central region is well-compressed to a very bright 
core.  There is a strong 3-dimensional effect as the core is covered with scores of fairly bright 
stars seemingly superimposed over a rich mat of fainter stars and all set over a background glow.  
The nucleus is small and very bright.  Many 11th-12th magnitude stars in the halo form complete 
loops and long chains.  A mag 7.7 double star is superimposed on the SW edge of the halo 
(h5085 = 7.7/9.2 at 2.8").  This was one of my favorite objects from Australia!

12" (6/29/02 - Bargo, Australia): this naked-eye cluster ranks second in terms of brightest 
members (mag 11.5). The 4' core has several dozen mag 12-13 stars, many arranged in streaming 
curves and chains layered over a dense central glow.  The halo is large but irregular with knots of 
mag 11-12 stars over a diffuse background.  The brighter members, particularly in the outer halo 
give the visual appearance of a globular embedded in a larger, open cluster!

8" (7/13/91 - Southern Baja): very bright, fairly large, 10' total diameter with a 2' brighter core 
which increases to very bright nucleus.  The large halo is very mottled and partially resolved 
although viewed at only 6 degrees elevation as the brightest stars are mag 11.  15-20 stars mag 
11-12 are visible around the edges of the core and within the halo in curved strings.  Mag 7.7 
SAO 254482 (h5085 = 7.7/9.2 at 2.8") is embedded in the SW portion of the halo 4.3' from the 
center.  Ranks second in terms of brightest individual stars and appears very rich.

view is confused, though, as a star or knot in directly involved at the NE end along with 1 or 2 
additional stars around the edges.  Excellent contrast gain with an OIII filter as the edges 
sharpened up and the halo appeared elongated 2:1 SW-NE, ~0.6'x0.3'.  At 225x, a mag 14-15 star 
is just off the NE end and the involved knot seemed to occasionally resolve into a couple of faint 
stars just north of center near the NE edge.  Finally, an extremely faint star occasionally sparkled

18" (8/26/06): excellent view at 323x and UHC filter.  Appears moderately bright, round, fairly 
large, ~60" diameter.  The rim is sharply defined and slightly brighter with a subtly darker center 
giving a weak annular impression.

18" (8/23/03): at 215x with a UHC filter, this planetary appears as an irregular, 60" disc, slightly 
elongated N-S.  The rim is slightly brighter, particularly along an arc from the SW to the N side, 
giving a weakly annular appearance.  At 538x the view is too dim but I noticed a couple of 
extremely faint stars along the edge of the rim.

17.5" (9/5/99): easily picked up at 100x as a 1' disc, appearing slightly irregular.  Best view at 
220x and 280x using a UHC filter.  The disc was quite irregular in surface brightness and slightly 
elongated N-S.  Most notably, the rim is generally brighter along the northern side in a broad "U" 
shape with the center weakly annular.  The south rim of the planetary is fainter and less well 
defined.  No central star seen at 380x.

17.5" (7/27/95): unimpressive coarse group of ~20 stars in a 7'x2' rectangular outline elongated 
N-S and appears to be nothing but an asterism.  Includes six brighter mag 9-11 stars.  The stars in 
this weak asterism simply form the border and there are no stars inside.  The extent of the group 
is arbitrary but I included a few mag 11 stars to the south giving the elongation.  A mag 8.5 star

18" (8/26/06): at 115x appears as a fairly bright but small, round disc with a blue-grey color.  
Excellent view at 435x with an irregular shape slightly elongated ~E-W, ~25"x20".  A brighter 
knot at the west end gives the appearance of being double or bipolar.  At 565x the surface 
brightness is noticeably irregular and an extremely faint star was occasionally visible at the west 
edge and also fleeting glimpses of a centrally located star.  

17.5" (9/5/99): fairly bright, but small disc picked up at 100x.  Easily takes high power. Nice 
view unfiltered at 280x - the PN has an irregular surface brightness with a brighter center but no 
central star and appears slightly elongated WNW-ESE, perhaps 20"-25" in diameter.  At 500x 
the outer edge of the rim fades and is not sharply defined.  At moments a sparkle was visible at

18" (7/14/07): at 225x appeared fairly bright, fairly large, round, perhaps 1.8' diameter.  A 
brighter rim is evident, particularly along the entire south half and extending for nearly 180 
degrees.  The rim is weaker on the N side giving a partial thick "C" or crescent appearance.  A 
mag 13.5 star is at the NE edge.

18" (8/14/04): at 225x, appears moderately bright, fairly large, round, at least 1.5' diameter.  A 
mag 13.5 star is at the NE edge of the rim with a fainter star off the NNW edge.  The rim is 
clearly brighter, paricularly along the entire south side, with the rim fading on the north side 
giving an asymmetric or crescent appearance. A large central "hole" appears slightly  darker.  At 
160x, one or possible two extremely faint stars flickered on and off within the interior of the disc 
but neither appeared to be the central star.

17.5" (6/30/00): at 220x unfiltered this fairly bright PN has a 1.5' round halo.  The rim is 
brightest and more well-defined along an arc on the S and SE rim.  The central 45" hole is 
slightly darker and irregular in surface brightness.  A mag 13 star is at the NE edge and once or 
twice I caught a fainter glimmer of an interior star north of center.
 
17.5" (7/12/99): at 100x appears fairly bright, round, ~1.6' diameter with a darker center.  I used 
a variety of magnifications and filters but the most interesting view was at 220x using a UHC 
filter.  With this combination the PN is slightly elongated E-W and clearly brighter along the 
southern rim with the brightening tapering towards the ends so this brighter portion had a 
crescent appearance.  Because of this asymmetric rim the darker center seems offset and only 
weakly brightens at the NW rim.  A mag 13 star is just off the NE edge 1' from center.

17.5" (8/2/86): at 222x and UHC filter; very large, about 1.8' diameter, much brighter on the SW 
portion of the rim, darker center.  A mag 13 star is just off the NE edge.

A faint star is off the E edge.

17.5" (7/1/00): this a large, beautiful cluster at 100x.  The central section is ~8' in diameter, 
roughly triangular and contains a scattering of ~20 10-11th magnitude stars.  There are no

18" (7/12/07): picked up at 115x as a small, hazy glow surrounding a mag 13.5 star.  Adding an 
OIII filter, this emission nebula appeared as a moderately bright, round, 1.5' glow surrounding 
the star.  At 174x the center "star" appears double and the nebulosity responds well to an OIII 
filter.  At 225x, the two close central stars are cleanly resolved and a third fainter star is just at 
the northern edge.  Adding a UHC filter, the shape is irregular and the overall outline shifts with 
averted vision, though it does not appear to be larger than 1.2'-1.5' visually despite a catalogued 
diameter of 3'.

17.5" (6/8/91): very faint, fairly small, very low surface brightness, forms an equilateral triangle 
with two mag 13 stars 2.8' SW and 2.8' SSE of center.  A close mag 14.5 star is 1' NNE.  Located 
5.2' S of a mag 9 star.  Forms a pair with ESO 460-030 = MCG -05-46-006 6' NNE.  Incorrect 
identification in the RNGC, SGC, ESO-LV.

On 30 July 30 1834, JH reported the discovery of a galaxy at 19 43 59.5 -28 33 04 (2000)  Near 
this position are two galaxies with a 5' separation; E460-G29 at 19 43 59 -28 29.2 (2000) and 
E460-G30 at 19 44 02 -28 24.1 (2000).  RNGC, ESO, RC3 and PGC identify N6816 = E460-
G30, although if you compare Herschel's coordinates the southern galaxy E460-G29 is a better 
match.

RNGC and ESO were probably influenced by the GC and NGC description of N6816 that 
mentions a "* north preceding."  There is a 9th magnitude star just W of E460-G30 and a close 
pair of faint stars on the west and northwest edge of the galaxy.  E460-G29 is located 5' S of this 
9th magnitude star.

But John Herschel's original Cape observation reads "eF, R, vlbM, 40", a *9 magnitude north of 
it, at 6' distance has what may be easily taken for a nebula attached to it, but it is only a little 
group of vS stars."  Based on this description, there can be no doubt that the southern galaxy 
E460-G29 = N6816.  Herschel probably observed E460-G30 near the mag 9 star but felt it was 
only a group of faint stars.

I discussed the situation in RNGC Corrections #5 and Corwin writes up a summary in 
NGCBUGS.

Also extends 5'-10' SW from the core of the cluster to a group of stars that wasn't included in the 
description of N6823.

The observation above refers to Sh 2-86 which is the commonly accepted identification of 
N6820, but based on Marth's position and description, N6820 probably refers to a very small 
knot of nebulosity to the SW of the cluster with the identification IRAS 19403 +2258.  At 220x, 
it appeared as a small, 20" knot of nebulosity surrounding a faint stellar or quasi-stellar core.  
Interestingly, this object dimmed with OIII, UHC and H-beta, so it's likely a reflection nebula 
that is detached from the main mass of nebulosity to the NE.

Includes about 10 brighter mag 11 stars.  There are no rich groupings but a very distinctive 3' 
string or stars oriented NW-SE marks the NE side of the group.  Stands out reasonably well at 
80x but not distinguishable at 220x.  Located 11' N of mag 8.1 SAO 105419.  In field with 
N6843 about 12' ENE.  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.

Discovered by WH (VIII 19).  JH (h2058): "a small, poor cluster; the preceding of two distinct 
clusters.  The stars 11m."  "Is a coarsely clustering part of the milky way."  Reinmuth describes 
"a very loose clustering of a few st 12...15."

17.5" (9/7/91): at 225x appears as a small, faint clump of stars over unresolved haze.  Elongated 
about 3:2 E-W with dimensions 1.5'x1.0'.  A mag 13.5 star is off the NW edge, a mag 14 star is

position given in RNGC, Lynga, N2000 and U2000 is exactly two degrees too far south.

Discovered by Stephan and correctly placed at 19 56 28.7 +32 21 16 (2000).  RNGC lists this 
open cluster at 19h 56.5m +30 21 (2000) or two degrees south of Stephan's position and I

18" (7/14/07): at 174x and OIII filter appears as a small but high surface brightness nearly 
circular knot, just 1' in diameter and sharply defined in a very rich star field.  Without a filter a 
mag 13 (illuminating?) star is visible at the center and two stars are at opposite edges (SW and 
NE).  At 280x the outline surface brightness is slightly irregular.  Located just inside a beautiful 
partial ring or loop of stars that includes a couple of double stars.  While viewing this object I 
noticed a fairly large, 3' low surface brightness hazy region about 10' W in the field.  This glow 
matches the location of Sh 2-99 (11' W of N6857).  There was no structure to this HII region and 
the surface brightness was uniform.  

18" (9/25/06): easily swept up at 115x as a small, high surface brightness nebula, roughly 1' in 
diameter, situated in a rich star field.  Excellent contrast gain with an OIII filter and appears quite 
bright with this combination.  At 300x, the nebula appears as a 1'-1.5' bright glow that spreads 
out mostly to the south of an embedded (possibly illuminating) mag 13.5-14 star in an irregular 
shape.  This HII region is located along one side of a near equilateral triangle of mag 12-13 stars 
with a mag 12 star just 40" SW.  A close, faint equal pair of mag 13.5 stars follows by 4'.

17.5" (8/7/91): very bright, moderately large, about 1' diameter, irregular outline, roughly 
circular but edges difficult to define, irregular surface brightness.  The mag 13.5 central star is 
quite prominent offset north of center. Surrounded by four fours; a mag 12 star at the SW edge 
[40" from center], two mag 13 stars off the NE end [40" from center] and off the NW end [52" 
from center], a mag 14 star at the SE end.  Located in a rich star field.  Excellent contrast gain 
with OIII filter.  Extremely faint nebulosity may extend to the west.  This is a compact HII 
region within Sh 2-100 and is misclassified as a planetary in the CGPN.

extent of the arms is probably greater than in any other spiral known; it is concluded that NGC 
6872 is a conventional barred spiral in which severe tidal interaction took place."  See

NGC 6873
20 07 13 +21 06.1

17.5" (8/25/95): fairly rich region but there is no noticeable clustering.  There is a 15' string 
starting from the mag 10 star at the NGC position going due W and ending at the bright double 
?2631 = 8.4/9.8 at 4.6".  This star is very possibly the double referred to in John Herschel's 
description with a 1.0 tmin error in RA -- Corwin concurs.

17.5" (7/7/94): the low power field (100x using 20 Nagler) surrounding the pretty double star 
Theta Sagittae = ?2637 (6.5/9.0 at 12") includes several bright stars but appears too sparse to be 
a cluster.  But 5' NE of Theta is a neat elongated group of 15 stars mag 12-13 forming a "?" 
asterism about 6' in length.  Theta Sagittae is located 1.7 tmin E and 11' S of Herschel's position 
so this identification is less likely than the one given above.

Discovered by JH (h2068 = ?2631): "A double star the chief of a coarse straggling group of stars 
10...13m hardly entitled to be called a cluster." JH's position (h2068) of 20 08 14 +21 06.4 
(2000) is exactly 1.0 tmin  E of the bright double ?2631 = 8.4/9.8 pair at 4.6" separation.  
Coincidentally his position falls on a mag 10 star, although it does not appear to be double. 
Described by Reinmuth as "a dense region; no Cl; double star 11.8 in Dreyer's place."  

In Deep Sky #31, Summer 1990, Skiff identifies the double star involved with the group as Theta 
Sge = ?2637 = 6.5/9.0 at 12" and 7.4 at 84" which is located at 20 09 56 +20 54.9.  "A sparse 
group centered on Theta Sge, which is the pair mentioned in the NGC description, and is clearly 
observable in my 6" refractor."  This group is more visually prominent (see visual notes from 
7/7/94) but does not correspond with John Herschel's position.  Brent Archinal concurs that the 
Theta Sge group is not N6873.

Corwin: JH's position (and so GC and NGC) is 1 minute of time too large.  The correct position 
for ?2631 (the double star noted in the description) puts it into the midst of a relatively rich 
Milky Way field.  But JH is right in calling it "... a coarse straggling group of stars 10...13m, 
hardly entitled to be called a cluster."  The grouping is approximately 13 arcmin x 10 arcmin 
with a center of gravity just south of the double very close JH's position corrected by 1 minute in 
RA.

17.5" (9/7/91): conspicuous subgroup at the NW corner of N6885.  About 15 stars in a tight 2' 
knot with three close brighter stars on the W side, over unresolved haze.  Sprays of stars forming 
the outline of N6885 seem to radiate from this group.  N6682 and N6885 appear as one cluster at 
low power.  It's very possible that N6882 = H VIII 22 is a duplicate observation of N6885 and 
does not refer to a distinct object.  In that case, this subgroup would be identified as Cr 416.  See 
Corwin's NGCBUGS for story.

From Brent Archinal 6/99
H.VIII.22 = GC 4557 = NGC 6882 - William Herschel recorded this object on September 10, 
1784. He listed it as of class VIII, i.e. a "coarsely scattered cluster of stars", with position 1m12s 
following and 0d 12' south of 18 Vul. His description is "A Cl. of co. sc. st.". We have for the 
position:

18 Vul (2000.0) 20 10 33.54 +26 54 15.0
18 Vul (1784.694) 20 01 34.72 +26 16 38.3

NGC 6882 (2000.0) 20 11 53 +25 42.5

Of course, the problem is there really is nothing quite like what Herschel described at his given 
position. His position matches that of object "c" above, and for some time I was ready to adopt 
this as the correct object. However, Harold Corwin [e-mail of July 23, 1998] has convinced me 
otherwise. Clearly "c" is not a class VIII object, and does not really match the description of a 
"coarsely scattered cluster". It seems more likely that Herschel simply made an approximately 
15' mistake in the declination, and in fact this object is group "a". Group "b" does not seem to be 
a likely candidate, since it is small enough and has faint enough stars to also not match as class 
VIII object or Herschel's description. So, the identification H.VIII.22 = NGC 6882 = object "a" 
seems likely, but as Corwin has pointed out, we'll probably never know for sure.

"Wishbone" asterism with a bright pair of mag 9.5/10 stars (17" separation) at the base of the 
wishbone.  The west side of the cluster is defined by a gently curving string of 10 faint stars.  At

the background.  At low power this region by other concentrations or asterism including 
Ruprecht 172 which spreads out to the southeast.

through mag 7.2 HD 192182.  A very faint hazy glow with no structure completed most of a 
large oval.

18" (8/23/03): Using a 6-inch off-axis mask with a 31 Nagler (73x) and an OIII filter, a faint 
curving arc is visible which begins SW of the mag 7.2 star on the north edge and curves around 
to the mag 8.2 star on the NE side, extending nearly 90° of arc along the annulus of the Crescent

17.5" (6/29/00): Stunning view at 100x (20mm Nagler) using an OIII filter.  The outline appears 
as a huge, irregular cosmic egg, ~18'x11', floating in a very rich Cygnus star field.  The complete 
annulus is easily visible.  The brightest section is along the north side and passes through a mag 
7.2 star at the north edge.  This piece displays much structure with several knots and wispy 
tendrils.  An isolated bright knot is within the weakly glowing interior and is collinear with the 
mag 7.2 star and the mag 7.4 central star. The interior has an irregular surface brightness with 
wispy striations that appear to radiate from the central star towards the NW rim at the end of the 
bright arc.  The rim is widest on the SW end with more nebulosity filling in towards the center.  
The fine texture and structure of the nebulosity creates a 3-dimensional feel and an "electric" 
effect.

17.5" (7/5/86): the "Crescent Nebula" is one of my favorite large nebulosities at 100x with a OIII

elongated SW-NE.  The rim is virtually complete except for a small piece of the east side and 
exhibits a great deal of turbulent, wispy structure.  Brightest just SW of mag 7.2 HD 192182 
(unequal pair O? 401 = 7.2/10.5 at 14") which is embedded in the rim at the north end.  The 
nebula also passes through mag 8.2 SAO 69611 on the NE side.  Just north of center in the 
interior is the mag 7.4 Wolf-Rayet star HD 192163 = WR 136, whose strong stellar wind created 
this shocked ring-type nebula.  This is beautiful nebulosity set in a very rich Milky Way field.

17.5" (8/25/95): appears to be a random scattering of brighter stars mainly noticeable because it 
includes mag 8 SAO 88571.  The brighter stars form a rectangle with side of 3'-4' and a string of 
brighter stars off the NW vertex extends another 4' to the N.  There are roughly two dozen stars

18" (7/2/08): at 565x, this interesting planetary had a very irregular surface brightness and 
appeared weaker on the N and S sides and slightly brighter in a triangular wedge that fanned out 
to the east from the central star.  The edge of the western rim was also very slightly enhanced but 
there wasn't a complete brighter wedge on the west side of the central star which would have 
created a subtle bipolar dumbbell shape. The faint central star was visible continuously at this 
magnification.

18" (8/23/03): beautiful planetary at 320x and 538x.  The mag 15.7 central star is easily visible 
continuously. The interior seems unevenly lit and there appears to be a very slightly darker 
"hole" to the north of the central star.  Bracketed by a mag 11 star off N edge and a mag 12 star 
just off the south edge and the planetary is slighly elongated N-S in the direction of these stars.

17.5" (8/31/86): very pretty planetary at 280x.  Fairly bright, fairly small, slightly elongated.  A

18" (9/3/08): beautiful view at 280x using an 8mm Ethos.  A large 2' "bar" is oriented E-W with 
a broad, weak concentration but suddenly rises to a very small, bright core and faint stellar 
nucleus.  On the east side of the bar, a spiral arm is attached that hooks directly to the north and 
just begins to sweep clockwise around on the north side of the galaxy towards the west.  There 
appears to a brightening (faint knot) near where the arm is attached to the bar.  Off the west side 
is faint haze on the south side, but the arm structure is very weak.  A mag 11.5 star lies 2.8' due E 
of center on line with the central bar.

17.5" (8/8/02): beautiful view at 220x.  This barred spiral appeared moderately bright and large 
with a fairly bright bar elongated "bar" oriented ~E-W with a small bright core.  At the following 
end of the bar an obvious arm is attached is attached sweeping north of the galaxy in a comma-
like appendage.  On the preceding end there seems to be a faint knot and there is a very short 
extension bending south which quickly fades out.

17.5" (9/14/85): at 192x appears moderately bright, bright core, elongated E-W.  Barred spiral 
structure is evident; fainter extensions form the bar and an arm at the eastern end of the bar 
curves north and then hooks slightly back to the west.  This spiral arm appears to end at a faint 
knot.  Two mag 11.5 stars lie 3' E and a similar distance south.  The eastern arm was listed 
separately by Albert Marth as NGC 6908.

18" (8/12/07): at 73x, this rich Milky Way region contains three sections of reflection nebulosity.  
The brightest piece (GN 20.22.9) was discovered by Stephan and is located 11' SW of mag 6.9 
HD 194708.  It involves two mag 11 stars and a mag 12.5 star on the west side.  About 6' S is 
another hazy patch (vdB 132 = GN 20.23.0) surrounding a wide mag 9/11 pair at 43".  Faint haze 
connects these two pieces and together they extend ~10'x3' in a N-S orientation.  This reflection 
nebula appears to be bounded on the west side by a non-illuminated dust cloud.

A third weak reflection nebula (VdB 131) is located 12' SSW of the brighter (northern) section 
of N6914.  It involves a group of 10-15 stars (Dolidze 8) including two mag 9.5 stars and a nice 
curving arc of stars is just off the southeast side.  Overally, the Milky Way is very patchy or 
dusty in this region so these reflection nebulae do not stand out prominently, though the contrast 
was improved using a Deep Sky filter.

To the SE of the N6914 complex is a very faint, hazy HII region (LBN 279), situated just east of 
mag 7.5 HD 194669.  It appears roughly 10'x6' in size and includes a number of mag 10-11 stars.  
There was only a weak response to a UHC filter, though there was no response to a Deep Sky 
filter and this is not part of the reflection complex.

17.5" (8/7/91): at 100x appears as a fairly bright field of reflection nebulosity locally brightest 
surrouding two pairs of fairly bright stars.  Two mag 11 stars are at the N end with a separation 
of 51" and a mag 9 (SAO 49589)/mag 11 pair with a separation of 42" is at the south end.  These 
two sections are separated by ~6' and are connected by a fainter elongated piece of nebulosity.  
Very faint nebulosity also extends NE towards a mag 7 star (SAO 49603) located 11' NE.  
Stephan's position is centered on the northern pair of stars.  A third piece surrounding a mag 9 
further SW was not noted.

8" (7/24/82): fairly large nebulous field locally brighter surrounding a wide faint double star and 
to the south surrounding a double star mag 9.  The brightest section is elongated N-S.

18" (6/25/04): at 300x, partially resolved into a couple of dozen stars, particularly on the south 
side of the very ragged 3' halo which surrounds the bright 50" core.  At 538x, perhaps 3 dozen 
stars are resolved mostly in the halo, but also several are superimposed on the very mottled core 
including one very close to the geometric center.  The halo is irregular, but clearly elongaged N-

out of view with the seeing and the cluster seems of the verge of more extensive resolution.

17.5" (8/5/94): bright, 3.0' diameter, round.  Fairly sharp concentration with a 1.5' diameter very 
bright core.  The halo has about two dozen stars peppered in the outer regions; the brightest star

18" (10/9/04): beautifully rich cluster of ~150 star in a 10'-12' triangular region over haze.  
Beyond the ends of the triangular vertices are four 10th magnitude stars with the star towards the 
ENE an easy double.  The cluster is fairly uniform with a rich clump of a half-dozen stars near 
the center.  A number of the stars are in chains, including a string of equally spaced 12-13th 
magnitude stars along the south side which is oriented NW-SE.  N6946 (which was sporting a 
supernova) lies 40' SE and both can be placed in the same low power field.

18" (8/17/04): this triangular-shaped rich cluster is beautifully framed in the 160x field (24'). The 
cluster is enclosed within a kite asterism of four mag 10 stars with two of these stars near the east 
and west vertices of the triangular outline.  ~125 stars are visible in a 10' diameter, with most of 
the stars mag 12-14.  Just west of center is a very rich 3' group and just following this group is a 
small knot of 4 very faint stars.  The west side is well-defined by a string of mag 12 stars 
oriented NW-SE.

17.5" (9/14/85): about 100-140 stars mag 12-15 are resolved.  Difficult to count as stars fill the 
22' field at 220x with no distinct boundaries.  N6946 is located less than 40' SE.

18" (8/1/08): I took another look at the young massive cluster located 2.8' WSW of the core of 
NGC 6946.  It was fairly easy to identify using a mag 13/13.5 pair of stars [18" separation].  The 
cluster is located 1.5' NW of the fairly wide double.  At 280x, the cluster appeared as a very 
faint, hazy glow, ~0.3' diameter.

18" (7/31/05): using the photographic finder chart in Astrophysical Journal (Vol  535: 748-758, 
2000) titled "A Young Globular Cluster in the Galaxy NGC 6946", I tracked down this 15 
million year old supermassive star cluster or young globular.  This object is located 2.8' W of the 
core and 1.5' NW of a wide, unequal pair of stars.  On the DSS, it appears to be located near the 
end of a faint arm (not seen) that attaches to the core on the south side and extends to the west.  
Using the image, I quickly pinpointed the location and at 323x a very faint, small, roundish glow 
of ~15" diameter was visible.  This very low surface brightness spot was visible 80-90% of the 
time with averted vision once identified and appeared similar to a faint Abell planetary.  Without 
the finder chart, I would probably have passed over this object without noticing it, and in fact 
missed it in my observation from the White Mountains in 8/29/02.  Using ALADIN, the position 
of the young globular is 20 34 31.7 +60 08 17.

18" (10/9/04): viewed type II supernova 2004e, discovered 9/27/04 (13 days ago) and appearing 
at approximately mag 12.8.  It was easily identified using a photographic finder chart.  The 
supernova is located 4.1' E and 1.9' S of the nucleus, just west of a pair of mag 13/13.5 stars at 
12" separation and was comparable to the brighter star of this pair.  A fainter mag 14.4 star is 
close WSW and the three stars plus supernova form a small wedge or Sagitta shaped group.  This 
is the 8th supernova discovered in N6946 since 1917.

17.5" (8/29/92): bright, very large, 6' diameter to main body, elongated 3:2 ~E-W.  Three arms 
are visible.  A long bright arm is attached at the north side of the core and trails to the east.  This 
eastern arm splits; a short fainter branch bends south following the core and a long curving bright 
arm terminates with a very faint, very small HII knot.  On the west side a fainter arm shoots 
sharply to the north from the core.  These outer arms significantly increase the diameter of the 
main body.  The galaxy has a very large brighter middle but the core is just a very small brighter 
region close SW of the geometric center.  A very faint stellar nucleus was seen with direct 
vision.  Observation from 12,000' in the White Mountains.

17.5" (8/13/88): main spiral arm very prominent and easily seen to split.

17.5" (9/14/85): bright, large, brighter central core.  A prominent arm attached on the NE side of 
the core and trailing to the east.  This arms splits - the shorter arm is close to the core and a 
brighter region or arm to the west.

13.1" (7/27/84): bright arm on the east side highly suspected to branch or split into two arms.  
Also an arm or brigter region seen on the opposite side of the galaxy pointing west a short way.

13.1" (7/16/82): the central region is elongated and fairly low surface brightness though a spiral 
arm clearly trails off to the easy a ways from the main body creating a non-symmetrical 
appearance.

8" (6/22/81): faint, large, diffuse, brighter core.  Situated in a rich star field.

18" (8/1/05): faintest of six in the N6962 group.  Appeared very faint, very small, round, 15"-20" 
diameter.  At first I thought it had a faint stellar nucleus with direct vision, but with careful 
viewing this was a mag 15-15.5 star at the south edge.  Located 1.3' N of a mag 13 star and on a

Discovered at Birr Castle on 27 Aug 1857 in the N6963 group.  In the NGC, Dreyer placed this 
galaxy 3' too far south at 20 47 25 +00 25 40 (2000).  This was caused by the Birr Castle sketch 
(wrong direction of drift) which led to confusions in subsequent catalogues.  Not found by 
Reinmuth (based on NGC position). Bigourdan later gave a precise postion as IC 5058 assuming 
it was a new discovery.

17.5" (8/4/02): at 220x appeared very faint, fairly small, round, 40" diameter, low even surface 
brightness.  Not noticed initially near position, but once identified could just hold steadily with 
concentration.  The identification of this galaxy with N6993 is not certain, but it roughly matches 
Leavenworth's field sketch and description.

Discovered by Leavenworth (list 1).  Not found by ESO or RNGC.  Wolfgang Steinicke initially 
identified N6993 with a faint galaxy at 20 59 30.0 -25 41 00, which matches Leavenworth's 
rough position.

Corwin: Since you sent that note last weekend, I've had a chance to look at the galaxy again.  
There is indeed a sketch and it does not  match the galaxy and star field at all.  Leavenworth's 
object is brighter and has several stars around it, and he comments about an envelope of 15th 
magnitude.  This also rules out the faint object near his position which has no corona, let alone 
one as bright as 15.

However, ESO 529-G011 = MCG -04-49-007 (5.5 minutes west and 13 arcmin north of 
Leavenworth's position) and its surrounding stars match the sketch pretty well (though the "stars" 
are small enough and displaced enough from their true positions that I thought at first sight that 
they might be photocopy defects), and the description matches perfectly.  I think this is probably 
the correct identification, so I've put it into my files.  But a visual confirmation would be 
valuable.

NGC 6996
20 56 30 +45 28.4
Size 5

18" (8/12/07): at 115x, ~40 stars mag 10-14 in a 6' region are mostly arranged in a "C" 
arrangement (or three sides of a rectangle), opening on the NW side.  Stands out somewhat in the 
field but not striking.  Located on the north (Canada) side of the North America Nebula.  More 
interesting is that on the east side of the group and curving around the north side is a well-
defined fairly high contrast dark nebula (Barnard 353).  I had the impression that the stars in the 
"cluster" were perhaps an absorption hole in this dark cloud.

17.5" (9/23/95): about 50 stars mag 10 and fainter within an 8'-10' group in the NE part of the 
North American nebula.  Fairly well-detached and distinguishable in a low power field but 
appears to be a typical Milky Way cloud with no particular dense spots.  Situated about 10' NW 
of a striking equilateral triangle of mag 8/9 stars with sides 2' (center at 20 57.0 +45 19).  
Barnard 353 (low contrast) is just following. The RNGC misidentifies N6997 as N6696.

Discovered by JH (h2094) and observed twice: "Coarse, poor, pL cluster, stars small." The 
RNGC dec is 50' too small and the position corresponds with N6997 so the RNGC has 
apparently misidenified N6997 as N6996 (error originated in Hogg).  This starcloud is located in 
the northern portion of the North America nebula.  See Corwin's NGCBUGS for a discussion on 
the observation.

18" (8/12/07): very nice group of ~75 stars at 73x in a 12' diameter.  A number of the stars are 
arranged in an oval outline extended ~E-W.  The cluster is fairly rich although there is no clear 
border and another smaller grouping is nearly adjacent to the NW.  Located near the "East Coast" 
(west side) of the North America Nebula.  Several mag 6-7 stars are within 15'-20' of the cluster 
including mag 6 HD 199579 17' S and  mag 5.6 HD 199870 20' SE.

17.5" (7/17/93): about 50 stars in a 10' diameter.  Located in the eastern U.S. portion of the North 
America Nebula.  Includes many mag 10.5-12 stars.  There are no rich portions and the group is 
somewhat scattered.  Roughly circular outline, weak concentration in center.

13.1" (6/30/84): fairly prominent scattered group at the west edge of N7000 (this is the "east"

separation N-S.

Discovered by WH (VIII 58). This cluster is incorrectly identified as N6996 by Lynga and 
RNGC.  This group is situated within the East Coast part of the North America nebula based on 
William Herschel's position.  See NGCBUGS for more information.  Possibly superimposed in 
the foreground of the North America nebula.

Marth discovered a pair of extremely faint, nearly stellar galaxies, N6998 and N6999 in April 
1864 which he oriented NW-SE.  N6999 was placed 22s of RA E and 2' S of N6998 which has 
coordinates of 21 01 37.7 -28 01 55 (2000).  Applying Marth's offset points exactly at E464-G15, 
located at 21 01 59.6 -28 03 32 (2000).  For some reason the RNGC has identified N6999 with 
an anonymous galaxy located 10' N of N6998 which is an obvious error.  The correct 
identification is given in the ESO. See RNGC Corrections #5.

18" (7/16/07): superb view of the entire North American nebula in the 80mm finder at 12.5x and 
at 73x in the 18-inch with UHC filters in both.  The entire outline of the U.S., Mexico and 
Central America was well defined and very high contrast with the surrounding dark fields 
particularly around the Gulf of Mexico region and the West Coast.  A 7th magnitude star is at the 
edge of the center of the gulf (Texas area) and another 7th magnitude star is at the south tip of 
Florida.  The "Baja peninsula" and Central American extension jut out very prominently from 
the gulf region. The edge of the northern Canadian region is less well defined.  Open cluster 
N6997 was very prominent on the East Coast (west side of the nebula).  It was breathtaking to 
scan around the entire outline, though it overfilled the 67' field.

lively in excellent seeing.  Two or three very faint stars were visible pretty steadily and a number 
of extremely faint mag 16 stars appeared to sharpen up and momentarily sparkle, particularly in

18" (9/10/07):  The "Fetus Nebula" is a fascinating annular planetary, best viewed at high power.  
Using 452x the oval halo is elongated SSW-NNE, ~85"x65". Most striking is a bright, 25" knot 
on the NNE end that is irregular in surface brightness with a very small brighter condensation 
near its south end.  The SW quadrant of the planetary is also brighter in an elongated region and 
it is weakest on the E and SE edge facing the wide double star off the S edge.  In the darker 
center, a mag 13.5 central star is visible and a second fainter mag 14 star is near the NE edge.  
Also a mag 14 star is just off the west edge.  N7008 is situated just north of h1606, a mag 
9.3/10.2 pair at 18" oriented N-S.  The planetary was faintly visible in the 80mm finder at 25x 
using an OIII filter.

17.5" (6/28/00): this beautiful, highly structured PN is situated just north of a wide double star 
(9.2/10.5 at 18"). At 280x, the annular oval is elongated SSW-NNE, ~90"x65".  A bright 30" 
irregular knot is prominent at the NE end.  The SW end of the major axis has a fainter 
condensation and the rim is clearly dimmest near the double star.  The mag 14 central star shines 
steadily as does a slightly fainter mag 14.5 on the NE edge.  Just off the west edge is another 
14th magnitude star.  The darker center is faintly luminous and the surface brightness is irregular 
over the entire oval giving a mottled, wispy appearance.

13" (9/11/82): bright planetary with unusual structure and several stars involved.  The striking 
complete annular ring is elongated SW-NE.  A mag 14 central star mag is visible as well as a

mostly north of the star and ending just south of the star in a well defined slightly curving border.  
A wide dark lane intrudes into the nebulosity from the southwest towards the bright star.  To the 
south of the star is a triangular region of haze (brightest just south of the central star) roughly 
filling in the region defined by a mag 13.5 star 5.5' SSE and a fainter star a similar distance SW.  
Seemingly detached at the periphery is a larger section of faint haze on the east side of the nebula

V = 8.5;  Size 18"x11"

18" (9/10/07): visible as a mag 8.5-9 "star" at 12.5x in the 80mm finder and easily identified 
using an OIII blink.  At 175x in the 18-inch, appears as a small, very high surface brightness oval 
with a blue-green color.  At 450x, this planetary is elongated 3:2 NW-SE, ~18"x12" and has an 
unusual bipolar appearance with two lobes.  The 10" NW component has a very high surface 
brightness and contains a quasi-stellar brighter knot on its west edge.  A fainter lobe juts out 
towards the SE and is slightly smaller (~8").  At 565x the SE lobe seems incomplete as if it was 
partially obscured and the two lobes are encased in a thin outer envelope.  The view was 
fascinating at 807x with the sense of peering at a 3-dimensional object - the brighter NW lobe 
being closer and the partially overlapping SE lobe extending away in space.  At this power both 
lobes were clearly irregular in shape and surface brightness.

17.5" (10/2/99): At 100x, the small greenish disc is very prominent but at higher powers appears 
bluish.  Easily takes very high power and the view unfiltered at 380x and 500x was striking.  
Appears elongated 3:2 NW-SE, 0.3'x0.2', with two distinct lobes.  The NW knot is slightly 
brighter and at times a stellar spot or star appears embedded at its SW tip.  At 500x, the two 
knots are encased in a very small common halo which extends further out on the north side.  The 
southern edge of both knots has a sharp, flat appearance.

13" (9/11/82): at 288x; small, bright, unusually high surface brightness, elongated NW-SE.  
There are two distinct overlapping nuclei and a narrow dark lane possibly separates these two 
condensations.

17.5" (8/2/97): brightest in a small group of galaxies - this object was quickly noticed to be 
double at 220x oriented WNW-ESE.  The very close components are just resolved, round, ~20" 
diameter each and very similar in brightness.  Several faint galaxies are in the field to the east 
including ESO 530-018, MCG +05-50-004 and ESO 530-020 (resolved triple galaxy).

Discovered by Muller (II).  His rough position is 21 11 -23 05.  ESO/Uppsala identify N7035 = 
E530-IG15, a close pair of interacting galaxies at a mean GSC position of 21 10 46.3 -23 08 09

The RNGC identification is uncertain but may apply to a faint edge-on E530-G18 = M-04-50-
005 at GSC position 21 11 21.0 -23 10 25 (or companion  M-04-50-004), although the dec is 2' 
too far south and is closer to another eF (anonymous) galaxy.  It is also possible that N7035 
refers to a close chain of three galaxies 4' E of the edge-on (though Muller would have probably 
resolved this trio).  No listing in RC3.

N7065A  21 26 57.8 -07 01 18  =M-01-54-018

Coincidently, this causes the RNGC declination to actually match that of N7065A although the 
RNGC orientation is correct.

Dreyer attributed N7065 to both Marth (m440) and d'Arrest although he noted a slight 
discrepancy in their position.  He decided to use d'Arrest's position in NGC.  Their positions for 
2000 are:

m440   21 26 58 -07 02
d'A    21 26 45 -07 00.1

Comparing these positions with the GSC strongly suggests that while d'Arrest observed the 
galaxy identified as N7065, Marth actually recorded the companion galaxy N7065A!  Both of 
these faint galaxies were visible in my 17.5" and neither was significantly more prominent.  So, 
it is possible that N7065A = M-01-54-018 should have been included by Dreyer as a separate 
entry from Marth.

18" (10/8/05): this "nonexistent cluster" is located in a glorious low power Milky Way field.  
Several groupings (both large and small) caught my eye at 73x (67' field), but I was mostly 
drawn to a fairly distinctive 4' string of stars oriented NW-SE.  At 225x, ~15 stars were packed 
into the string, most stars being mag 13-14 with a few fainter stars, and possibly over unresolved 
Milky Way background glow.  This group would have likely caught John Herschel's eye as he 
swept the region, though it may be an asterism (not in Lynga).

18" (10/9/04): picked up at 73x (31 Nagler) as a fairly small (for an Abell planetary), fairly faint 
disc, perhaps 35"-40" in diameter.  Appears evenly illuminated at low power.  Viewed unfiltered 
at 160x and a couple of faint stars are embedded, one at the east edge and another at the north.  
Only a weak contrast gain using the OIII filter and easier to view unfiltered at 225x.  At this 
power the shape appears irregular and brighter along the east side.  Neither of the two stars 
appear to be the central star as they're situated near the edge of the halo.  A number of 13-15th 
magnitude stars are in the field including a couple of 14th mag stars 1' and 2' N and a small, 
fainter trio close west.  Located 56' ENE of mag 2.5 Alpha Cephei (Alderamin).

17.5" (7/5/86): fairly faint at 79x using an OIII filter, slightly elongated, moderately large, 
estimate V = 13.5-13.8.  Faintly visible unfiltered.  At 222x two stars are superimposed; a faint 
star near the center (central star?) and one at the north edge.  On line with two mag 14 stars 1' N 
and 2' N.  Located 15' SE of mag 7.2 SAO 19386.  Identified as Abell 75 in CGPN and ESO-
Strausberg catalogues.

This object was first recorded by WH as III 936.  His position was 7 min 54 sec following Alpha 
Cephei and 16' north.  This places it at 21 26.5 +62 51 (2000).  Just 2' N of this position is the 
planetary Abell 75 which was rediscovered by Abell but not associated with the NGC number.  
The ESO-Strausberg planetary catalogue also uses the Abell designation.

RNGC lists N7076 as a diffuse nebula instead of a planetary and furthermore the declination is 6' 
too far S. The ESO-Strausberg catalogue gives a precise 2000 position 21 26 24.1 +62 53 27. I 
found the equivalency N7076 = Abell 75 and listed it in the 3rd RNGC Corrections list.

Alvin Huey: 22" f/4.1 (155, 203 and 293x) - This is a slightly elongated (1.5:1) patch that has a

apparently using the NPD of N7097 and placed N7095 at 21 35 48 -42 46.3 (1950)

Because of this error the RNGC has misidentified N7095 = E287-G42 at 21 34 58 -42 49.8

Discovered by Marth (m448). Because of a mix-up in the original published positions of N7100 
and N7101 (Marth's dec was 6' in error), N7101 = M+01-55-007 is identified in CGCG and PGC 
as N7100 instead of N7101 (MCG gives the correct ID although listed as uncertain). RNGC 
identifies N7101 with an extremely faint companion close NW of the real N7101 (which is 
misidentified as N7100). See RNGC Corrections #2 although my conclusions are not valid.  This 
galaxy is not listed in UGC or RC3.

Discovered by Marth at 21 40 55 -06 46 (2000).  There is no object at this position but exactly 
1.0 tmin E is N7111, correctly placed by Stephan at 21 41 53.8 -06 42 32 (2000).  The galaxy 
identified as N7108 in the RNGC is a virtually stellar galaxy surrounded by several faint stars 
and located over 20 arcmin following Marth's position and 12' ESE of N7111.  The simplest 
solution here is to assume a 1.0 min error in RA by Marth, and equate N7108 = N7111

See observing notes for N7713.

Malcolm Thomson: N7112, N7113 were discovered by Swift in July 1886 and Marth in April 
1863, respectively.  Their discovery positions (precessed to 2000) and descriptions are as 
follows:

N7112  21 42 20 +12 34 47
eeF, S, R, pB* with dist companion close p; v diff.
N7113  21 42 27 +12 37
vF, S, stell

The RNGC and CGCG identify these numbers with the following two galaxies:
(R)N7112  21 42 22.9 +12 29 54
U11794 = M+02-55-010 = Z427-014

(R)N7113  21 42 26.7 +12 34 09
M+02-55-009 = Z427-016

MCG does not assign a NGC number to the first galaxy but identifies the second galaxy as 
N7112.

Marth's position for N7113 is 3' S of M+02-55-009 but is an exact match in RA.  Swift's RA for 
N7112 matches M+02-55-010 although his declination would then be 5' off and actually matches 
N7113.  Furthermore, his description "pB* with dist companion p" applies to N7113 as mag 8.7 
SAO 107337 is located 1' preceding.  This bright star also has a "distant companion", which is a 
mag 13 star 53" ENE.  Finally, if Swift was not aware of Marth's discovery then he most likely 
recorded the brighter of the pair which is N7113.  So, based on Swift's visual observation it 
appears likely that N7112 = N7113.

Discovered by WH (VIII 63): "A S Cl of pL st." Reinmuth writes "no distinct cluster" and 
repeated in Carlson and RNGC.  Described as 8 packed stars at 255X by Ling (similar to my 
visual observation).  GSC shows two of the stars and the position of the brightest mag 14 star is 
22 12 18.0 +57 03 12.  This place is 4.5' N of the NGC position.  Close to the NGC position is a 
pair of mag 12-13 stars but no surrounding stars.  See NGCBUGS as Corwin shows that N7234 
is a duplicate of N7235.

17.5" (11/2/91): two dozen stars mag 9-15 in a 4' diameter at 220x.  This moderately 
concentrated group is elongated WNW-ESE and includes several fairly bright stars.  A mag 9 
star is at the east end and there are eight other mag 10-11 stars.  Just west of the mag 9 star is a 
1.5' circular hole with no stars.  A mag 10 star at the extreme west edge has six faint stars mag 
13/14 close following.

A compact group of faint stars 13' S appears as a small, partially resolved nebulous glow at 100x.  
At 220x, 7 stars are resolved from mag 14-15.5 within a 1.5' diameter.  I had taken this as N7234 
but Corwin's re-reduced position from William Herschel indicates that N7234 is identical to 
N7235.

Another poor position from Leavenworth (I) given roughly as 22 22 -15 34 (2000) .  Not found 
by Bigourdan and there are no objects near Leavenworth's position.  RNGC lists N7255 as 
nonexistent.

But using Leavenworth's discovery sketch, Corwin has positively identified N7255 = M-03-57-
006 at 22 23 08.0 -15 32 29 (2000).  This implies that Leavenworth's position was roughly 1 
tmin too far W.  Not plotted on U2000.0.  Incorrect PA = 57° in ESGC and from Leavenworth = 
30°.

identification in the RNGC and misplotted on the U2000.

On 27 September 1834, JH described this galaxy as "vF, S, R, the preceding of 2" with N7277 
and he placed it 30 tsec of RA preceding N7277 and 3' S.  A later observation on 18 August 1835 
confirmed this separation.  In compiling the NGC, Dreyer accidentally  placed N7268 1.5 tmin 
west of N7277 and no galaxy exists at this position.  But exactly at h's original offset from 
N7268 is the double galaxy E467-IG 057 = MCG -05-53-001/002 at 22 25 41.0 -31 12 02 
(2000).  This galaxy is identified as N7268 in ESO, SGC and N2000.0.  The RNGC clearly 
misidentifies N7268 (possibly as E467-IG55) as the stated position is 14' S and 1.0 tmin of RA 
preceding N7277.  This galaxy is plotted too far south on the first version of U2000.  Discussed 
in RNGC Corrections #5 and Corwin's NGCBUGS.

17.5" (7/1/89): very faint, small, slightly elongated, bright core.  This identification of this galaxy 
with N7287 is very uncertain and the number may apply to a double star at 22 27 17.2 -22 07 03.

Discovered by Muller (II) and described as a "slightly nebulous **."  .  His position is 0.2 tmin 
W and 4' N of E602-020A.   Identified as a double star by Howe although the seeing was poor.  
This galaxy is identified as N7287A = E602-020A in RC3.  ESO equates N7287 with E602-020 
which is one magnitude fainter at the identical position as E602-020A.

Burnham (Publ of Lick Observatory, II) found two very faint objects about 20" apart although 
the following one appeared to a faint star only.  I only recorded a single object in my visual 
observation.

Corwin notes N7287 may be a double (or triple) star as Muller originally stated (See 
NGCBUGS).  But his position falls in a group of galaxies and it may have been the faint galaxy 
described here (Corwin feels this is less likely).

bulges out due to a faint extension or large filament that begins just south of the western side of 
the rim and extends north towards a brighter star at the NW edge of the halo.

17.5" (10/2/99): gorgeous view at 100x and OIII filter.  This huge, annular PN is 15'x12' in size 
and slightly elongated E-W due to an extension on the W side.  The thick annulus is mottled and 
irregular with brighter regions along the N, NE and SW edge.  The W side is slightly weaker but 
very faint extensions from the N and S side towards the W, cause the rim to bulge on this side.  
The west edge of the halo more gradually blends into the background near a mag 11.5 star off the 
W side.  At 220x without a filter about a dozen stars are superimposed.  The mag 13.5 central 
star is easy along with a similar star a couple of arcminutes following.

13.1" (8/15/82): the "Helix" nebula is extremely large, about 15' diameter, clearly annular.  
Significant contrast gain with OIII filter permits observation even from the Bay Area. The fairly 
bright rim is nonuniform appearing brighter along the N side.  About seven stars are 
superimposed including the mag 13.5 central star.  Appears best at low power due to size and 
relative low surface brightness.  Easy in the 80mm finder.

8" (10/4/80): huge annular planetary is fairly bright at low power using a Daystar 300 filter.  The 
rim has an irregular surface brightness.

17.5" (10/21/95): this asterism consists of ~10 stars including a mag 10 star at the E end and 
eight mag 12-13 star in an E-W string about 3' length.  Located 6' SW of mag 7.6 SAO 34488.  
In addition, there are also several mag 15 stars surrounding the mag 10 star which are easier to 
view with averted vision.  Appears to be an unimpressive random grouping at both 100x and

The identification of this asterism with N7295 is uncertain, and if John Herschel made a 30' error

22 36 48.4 +34 22 02
Size 15"

17.5" (10/17/98): this is a very faint double star 4.5' SW of the core of N7331.  At 220x only the 
brighter mag 14 component was evident but at 280x and 380x a fainter mag 15 companion at 15" 
south was visible.  A wide pair of mag 12/13 stars which are collinear with the core of the galaxy 
lie 1.5' NW.  RNGC misidentifies N7325 with PGC 69291 at 22 36 33.4 +34 30 05.

Discovered by Schultz.  His micrometric position and Rosse's offset from N7331 both fall 
precisely on a mag 14/15 double star at 15" separation with one of the components an extremely 
close double.  The brighter component has a GSC position 22 36 48.4 +34 22 02 (nonstellar).  
Reinmuth lists a "? Neb *14.8" although Carlson has a SBc gx.

N7325 is incorrectly identified in the RNGC with an extremely faint galaxy ~7' NW of N7331 
(PGC 69291 at 22 36 33.4 +34 30 05).  On the POSS this galaxy appears to have a fairly bright 
star superimposed making visual observation extremely difficult.  See Deep Sky, Fall 1986,

22 36 52.0 +34 25 22

17.5" (10/17/98): this entry is from the Lord Rosse observations of N7331 and refers to a faint, 
close double star just 2.5' preceding the nucleus.  This object was not seen with certainty at 220x, 
but clearly visible at 280x and 380x as a mag 15.5 star (not resolved).  The RNGC incorrectly 
identifies N7326 with CGCG 514-066.

Discovered by Lord Rosse.  His accurate offset from N7331 of 165" in PA 278.7° points directly 
to a close double star 2.5' preceding the nucleus of N7331 at GSC position 22 36 52.0 +34 25 22 
(2000).  This object is also identified as a double star by Carlson based on Mount Wilson and 
Lick Observatory plates.

RNGC incorrectly identifies N7326 as CGCG 514-066 which is located 12' NW of N7331.  See 
article on N7331 in Deep Sky, Fall 1986 and RNGC Corrections #1 as well as Corwin's

NGC 7327 = ?
22 36 57.3 +34 28 02

17.5" (10/17/98): this number refers to one of the several nonexistent NGC entries in the N7331 
vicinity.  A possible candidate suggested by Harold Corwin is a mag 13 star near the tip of the 
northern extension of N7331.  This single star appeared stellar, although it seems plausible that it 
might look slightly nebulous due to the faint background haze of the galaxy.  Other fainter 
nearby stars may instead apply to N7327.

Discovered by Tempel.  His original description is vague: "preceding the northern end of 
N7331".  There are no galaxies or double stars nearby, so he may have mistaken a single faint 
star.  Corwin suggests the mag 13 star at 22 36 57.3 +34 28 02 (2000) as a reasonable candidate 
in NGCBUGS.  Another possibility is the compact galaxy with a star superimposed which 
RNGC identifies as NGC 7325, although this is 4' NW of Tempel's positoin.  Unfortunately, 
Tempel didn't leave any additional clues as to the identification of N7327.  See my article on 
N7331 in Deep Sky, Fall 1986 and NGCBUGS.

18" (8/17/04): at 225x, moderately bright, fairly small, ~30" diameter.  A mag 14 star is just off 
the SW edge with a mag 14.5 star a bit further west.  At 435x appears slightly brighter along 
portions of the rim, particularly along the SE side.

17.5" (11/6/99): a fairly bright, 25" disc is visible at 100x with one or two stars very close.  At 
280x, the PN is slightly elongated E-W, ~25"x20".  A mag 14 star is close off the SW edge, 30" 
from center and a mag 14.5 star is 0.6' due W.  At 380x, a mag 15-15.5 star is 0.6' WNW and the 
surface brightness is noticeably irregular with hints of brighter areas.

13" (7/12/86): fairly bright, fairly small, slightly elongated.  A mag 14 star is just off the SW 
edge.  Pretty with a UHC filter at 166x, estimate V = 12.0.  Takes high power without a filter.

8": faint, small, round, but easily visible at 100x or higher and takes 200x. Very faint star is at 
the SW edge.

17.5" (8/26/00): at 220x, this was a marginal sighting as it appeared to pop into view a few times 
momentarily and I had the impression it was elongated.  Forms the N vertex of a small 
equilateral triangle with two mag 15 stars ~1.5' SW and SE.

Discovered by JH (h3952).  Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.  Herschel's position is exactly 1 
degree south of E406-006 and this galaxy is identified as N7355 in ESO.  There is also ESO 
galaxy very close the NGC position but it is 16.8B.  Herschel mentions "a double star follows 
about 40s on the parallel."  This description matches E406-006 which has a wide pair (mag 
10/13) at 30" separation so this identification is nearly certain.  See NGCBUGS.

Identification reversed with N7402 in the RNGC and not identified as N7401 in the CGCG.

N7401 and N7402 are a close pair of galaxies discovered by  Lord Rosse on 2 Oct 1856 in a 
group containing N7396 (discovered previously by JH) along with the Rosse "novae" N7397 and 
N7398.  This group was examined five times by the Birr Castle observers although this is the 
only observation in which all five galaxies were recorded with certainty.  N7402 was called 
"doubtful" by Rosse on the 1857, Oct 23 observation although the position given close following 
N7401 is correct. 

The first three NGC entries (N7396, 7397, 7398) have secure identities   According to the Rosse 
sketch, N7401 and N7402 are a close pair, oriented approximately E-W (NGC gives  5 sec of RA 
separation).  This matches up well with N7401 = MCG +00-58-010 = CGCG 379-013 at 22 52 
58.4 +01 08 33 (2000) and N7401 = extremely compact companion 1.5' following at 22 53 04.5 
+01 08 39 (2000).

N7401 = MCG +00-58-010 is identified as N7402 in the MCG, RC3 and DSFG and listed as an 
anonymous galaxy in the CGCG (379-013).  RNGC and the first edition of DSFG reverse the 
identifications of N7401 and N7402 according to their RA and X coordinates which have N7401 
following N7402.  See RNGC Corrections #2 and NGCBUGS.

The identification of this galaxy with N7414 is very uncertain and it appears to be too faint to 
have been picked up by Swift.

On 2 Sept 1886 Swift recorded the following two objects in list 4:

N7413  22 54 48 +13 13 05 (2000)
eeF, pS, R, e diff, 8 or 10 st. in an irregular line p, s of 2

N7414  22 54 48 +13 15 35 (2000)
eeeF, S, R, eee dif, n of 2

According to these positions, Swift placed N7414 2.5' due N of N7413.  Using the 20" refractor 
at Chamberlin Observatory, Herbert Howe made a number of micrometric measurements of 
NGC objects and corrected the position of N7413 14 tsec further east.  This would place N7413 
at 22 55 02 +13 13 05 (2000).  This position matches up precisely with MCG +02-58-035 at the 
GSC position 22 55 03.1 +13 13 14.  Furthermore, there is a string of stars to the SW matching 
Swift's description.

No galaxy exists at either Swift's original position for N7414 or by applying Howe's offset 
although there are a couple of very faint stars about 2' N of N7413.  Instead, the RNGC has 
identified N7414 with an extremely small and faint galaxy, NPM1G +12.0575, located 5' ENE of 
N7413 at 22 55 24.3 +13 14 54 (J2000).  So, N7414 should probably be listed as nonexistent 
with a possible identification as a faint star.  A visual observation of NPM1G +12.0575 would 
help to determine if this galaxy was detected by Swift.  Discussed in RNGC Corrections #4.

Rosse discovered the galaxy that RNGC, CGCG (475-006), UGC (notes to N7436) all identify as 
N7431 on 12 Oct 1855.  Although clearly shown on the sketch, the 29 Sept 1875 observation 
states "the object preceding in the 1857 sketch is a faint star, night bad."  Because of this last 
statement, Thomson feels Dreyer decided to not include this object in the NGC since N7431 is 
attributed to Bigourdan.  Rosse's object (M+04-54-003 = CGCG 475-006 = PGC 70112) is 
located 1.5' NW of N7436 and was missed in my 17.5".  This galaxy is identified as NGC 7433

17.5" (11/18/95): extremely faint and small, round, 15" diameter, very low surface brightness.  
Requires averted vision but observation repeatable.  Located 3.1' W of N7459.  A mag 14.5 star 
lies 2.1' SSW.  This galaxy is not listed in any modern catalogue and the identifications of N7452 
and N7459 are not certain due to poor positions by Lewis Swift.

Discovered by Swift (II) along with N7459 (and N7455).  His position falls in a small but rich 
cluster.  RNGC and MCG identify N7452 as the brightest member UGC 12302 = MCG +01-58-
021.  This is a double system with nuclei only 10" apart.   Howe apparently also identifies this 
galaxy as N7452 (MN, Vol 60, 129).

Instead, Corwin suggests that N7452 may be an anonymous galaxy at GSC position 23 00 47.5 
+06 44 44 (J2000).  This places N7452 21 tsec of RA preceding Swift's position (exact in dec) 
and roughly matches his offset for N7455 (38 tsec of RA).

This also implies N7459 = U12302 which is 12 tsec following (Swift's offset is 20 tsec).  
Interestingly, Howe mentioned he  suspected another neb preceding by 15 tsec [of the galaxy he 
identified as N7452].  This probably refers to the galaxy Corwin identifies as possibly N7452.

Discovered by Swift (II) along with N7452.  This number is listed as nonexistent in RNGC and 
is not identified by Reinmuth. Corwin suggests this number may refer to UGC 12302 = MCG

Swift's RA is 29 tsec further E (of U12302) and is comparable to his error of 38 tsec for N7455 
discovered on the same night.  If this identification is correct, N7452 possibly refers to a 
previously uncatalogued galaxy 12 tsec of RA further W.

Another problem is that the UGC dec for U12302 is 5' too far N and UGC does not give the 
equivalence with MCG +01-58-021.  See NGCBUGS.

18" (11/7/07): I was surprised the thin spiral arm was readily visible from Lake Sonoma 
extending from the south end of the bar and wrapping outside the mag 13.5 star situated 50' SW 
of the core.  This arm dimmed out roughly due west of the star.  The central bar extends 2.4'x0.6' 
N-S and contains a bulging 25" core that broadly brightens to an occasional faint stellar nucleus 
with direct vision.  Barely off the N end of the central bar is a mag 12.5 star (1.3' due north of 
center) and there was just a hint of the north end of the bar starting to bend towards  the east.

18" (10/19/06): fairly bright, fairly large, the main bar appears elongated 3:1 N-S, moderately 
concentrated with a bright core.  A mag 12.5 star is just off the north tip of the bar.  At the south 
end an extension is generally visible with averted vision hooking back sharply on the west side 
towards the north.  This spiral arm dims as it hooks but intermittently appears to sweep due north 
though does not extend as far as the mag 13.5 star off the SW side of the core.

17.5" (7/19/90): this is one of few northern barred spirals in which the structure is clearly visible. 
A bright bar is oriented N-S with a bright core and nearly stellar nucleus. A mag 13 star is off the 
N edge 1.4' from center and a fainter mag 14 star is 47" SW of center. A thin curving spiral arm 
attached at the south end curves to the west and then north beyond the mag 14 star SW of the 
core. This arm parallels the bar along the west side about 90°. At the Sierra Buttes, the spiral arm 
was held almost continuously with averted vision. Located 3.3' NNE of a mag 10 star.

17.5" (10/12/85): thin curving arm clearly seen attached at the SW end curving to the north 
around a faint star.

13.1" (9/29/84): fairly bright, elongated ~N-S.  Strong impression of a dark lane or gap on the 
west wide and brief hints of haze beyond this gap, particularly around the south end towards the 
west (spiral arm).

NGC 7486
23 06 06.7 +34 04 25

17.5" (8/13/88): this number refers to three mag 15 stars located ~2' ESE N7485.  Not knowing 
the nature of this object, I logged N7486 as "very faint, extremely small, forming a close pair 
with a mag 15 star" and assumed this observation referred to a very small galaxy.  But on close 
inspection of the DSS, my "extremely small" object is just two very close mag 15 stars that form 
a tight triple with the mag 15 star I noted.  Using Lord Rosse's 72", Copeland made the same 
error.

N7485 was observed twice at Birr Castle and the 1871 observation mentions a "D neb f a little s 
[of N7485]".  In 1876 Copeland again logged this galaxy (GC 6251) as "vF, vS, undoubtedly 
seen, position angle 109.5°± and distance 114"."  This object entered the NGC as N7486.  At this 
precise offset from N7485 is compact group of 4 faint stars which I also mistook as a nebulous 
object in my 17.5"!

So, the RNGC type of N7486 should be changed to 7 and the new description to "= grp of 4 
stars"  GSC lists a pair of mag 15 stars at 6" separation with a mean position of 23 06 13.2 +34 
06 11 (2000).  The galaxy identified as N7486 in RNGC is actually N7485.  See Catalogue

The RNGC positions need to be slightly modified to N7521 at 23 12.3 -01 52 (1975) and N7524 
at 23 12.5 -01 52.  The CGCG completely misplaces the position of N7524 by over 5° and

Faintest of five (along with N7558) in HCG 93.

This galaxy was probably discovered at Birr Castle although the sketch does not properly place 
CGCG 454-015, so the NGC identification is uncertain.

This object was discovered by the Rosse observers in a group of galaxies with brightest member 
N7550 = HCG 93A.  Neither Rosse nor Schultz, who also examined the field, gave specific 
positions for this object so I'm not sure how Dreyer arrived at the NGC position.  A diagram of 
the field was made at Birr Castle on 6 Oct 1877 and confirmed on 10 Oct 1877 and the four 
galaxies, N7547, N7549, N7550 and N7553 are shown.  Although the direction of drift shown is 
somewhat off, it is easy to match the sketch with the POSS except for N7553.  The brightest 
galaxy near Rosse's position is CGCG 454-015 at 23 15 33 +19 03.0 (2000) and this is the galaxy 
identified as N7553 in the RNGC.

It is certainly possible this was the object seen at Birr Castle (although very faint, it was clearly 
seen in my 17.5"!) , though the sketch does not match up well with CGCG 454-015 and the 
indicated position falls closer to an extremely faint star and galaxy at 23 15 38.7 +18 58 25 
(2000).  But, this latter object may be too faint to have been picked up visually by Rosse.  
Finally, there is a close double star near CGCG 454-015 at 23 15 36.3 +19 01 54 (2000) which is 
also a possible candidate.

Discovered by Swift (IV).  There is a mag 14 star less than 1' N of Swift's published position.  
But, according to Corwin there was a two-degree error in Swift's declination and his description 
is a good match with U12472.  See NGCBUGS.  Listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.

Discovered by Marth (m555).  His declination is 2' too far N.  MCG (+01-59-034) identifies this 
galaxy as N7583 but CGCG lists this galaxy as anonymous (404-047) and CGCG 406-033 3' N 
is identified as N7583.  This latter galaxy is probably N7604.

Marth's position actually matches CGCG 406-033 in declination but considering that Marth only 
found one object this night, it is reasonable that he picked up the brightest of the trio, M+01-59-
034.  Reinmuth also gave this identification.

Marth probably reobserved this galaxy later as m568 = N7605 but the RA was 1.0 tmin too large.

An imprecise discovery position was given by Common at 23 18 28 +10 12 (2000).  RC3, MCG,

elongated system 0.7x0.3 roughly E-W.  CGCG also catalogues this galaxy, but as IC 5306.

Common's original description (Dreyer cut it down) reads: "F, R, f 3 stars in a line 90 degrees 
pointing to another fainter nebula s(outh)."  This description makes it clear that N7594 = 
Bigourdan's IC 1478 as there are two stars preceding (and IC 5305) which are collinear with IC 
5306 to the south.

Kobold's position for group members IC 5305/06/07 are all exact.  Identification originally found 
by Corwin and I independently uncovered the same identifications when examining Vicker's 
CCD Atlas.

Marth's RA for N7604 is exactly 1.0 tmin larger than M+01-59-033.  But assuming the same 
mistake was made on m568 = N7605 (observed on same night) then N7605 matches brighter 
N7583 which Marth discovered on an earlier sweep, so this identification is reasonable.  
Reinmuth (and RNGC) also give this identification.

MCG lists this galaxy as anonymous M+01-59-033 and CGCG identifies this galaxy (406-048) 
as N7583.  RNGC identification is correct. GSC position 23 17 51.9 +07 25 48.

See observing notes for N7643.  The identification of this number is uncertain but may apply to 
N7643 if Swift made a two degree error in dec.

Swift discovered both N7644 and N7651.  N7651 appears as #96 in list 4 at 23h 21.9m +13d 42' 
and N7644 later appears as #100 in list 5 in AN 2762 with 1950 coordinates of 23h 20.7m +13d 
42'.

The double system M+02-59-036 = CGCG 431-055 at 23 21 54.6 +13 41 58 (1950) is an 
excellent match with N7651.  The RNGC entries for N7644 and N7651 both refer to the 
components of this system.  But due to relatively large difference in RA, Swift was probably 
referring to two distinct galaxies.  It's possible that N7644 refers to a faint galaxy located W of 
N7651 at 23 23 28.5 +13 58 40 (2000), which is a good match with Swift's position but Corwin 
feels this galaxy is too faint and small to match Swift's description.  See NGCBUGS.

V = 8.3;  Size 32"x28"

18" (9/10/07): viewed this gorgeous double-shelled planetary at 807x in good seeing.  The outer 
envelope is a sharply defined 35"x25" oval, oriented SSW-NNE.  Roughly half-way to the center 
is a remarkable, thin oval ring oriented SW-NE (slightly offset in orientation compared to the 
outer shell) of very high surface brightness.  This annular ring is brightest along a 90° arc on the 
south side and is also enhanced along a shorter arc at the west edge of the northern part of the 
ring.  The ring fades and appears broken with a gap along the west to WNW edge.  Inside the 
ring is a darker oval hole that is weakly luminous.

18" (10/19/06): In steady seeing, the double-shell structure was remarkable at 807x (7mm Pentax 
+ 2.5x Powermate).  The outer envelope is noticeably oval SW-NE, ~35"x25".  Embedded 
within this envelope is a fairly thin, very bright inner ring with a sharply defined outline.  The 
ring was irregular in surface brightness but clearly brightest at the SW and NE ends of the ring 
(ends of the major axis).  The ring fades on the NW side and there was a small, distinct gap in 
the ring at the NW end. The surface brightness of the inner ring was high enough to give a 
glowing "electric" quality with an impression of a rope-like or twisted structure.  The center of 
the ring was much darker than the ring and formed a substantial dark oval at this magnification, 
but was still clearly luminous.

17.5" (10/13/01): at 500x, this blue high surface brightness planetary has a beautiful double-shell 
structure with a small, dark center.  The bright inner structure has a delicate, embedded thinner 
ring of very high surface brightness which is weaker at the following end.  In the center of this 
ring is a small, darker hole.  The fainter, outer envelope is elongated SW-NE, ~35"x25", giving 
an asymmetric appearance with the outline of the inner ring.

17.5" (10/12/85): extremely bright, very high surface brightness, fairly small, easily takes very 
high power.  At 410x, the planetary appears weakly annular with a slightly darker center.  There 
is a second outer shell which exhibits subtle structure due to an irregular surface structure, blue-
green color is evident.  Central star not seen.

13" (9/11/82): darker center, faint outer shell.

8" (9/25/81) : slightly darker center at 300-400x, irregular surface brightness.

JH's mean position from two observations of h2247 = N7681 is 23 26 23 +17 01 38 (1950).  
Bigourdan also measured the position of N7681 as 23 26 21 +17 02 52.  U12620 = M+03-59-063

Bigourdan's measurements.

Despite this match RNGC, RC3, CGCG, UGC notes and N2000 all misidentify this number with 
M+03-59-060.  This galaxy is located 6.2' WSW of N7681 and is much fainter than U12620.  
Finally, h mentions "near a double star" which agrees with my visual observation of U12620 as a 
pair of 11-12 magnitude stars lie 2' NE.  This identification was confirmed by Thomson and 
Corwin (NGCBUGS).  MCG is the only catalogue to identify N7681 = U12620.  The V 
magnitude = 14.8 and B = 15.7 given in the RC3 must be incorrect.  The PGC gives B = 14.8.

Discovered by WH (III 189). Not observed by JH or at Birr Castle. Incorrectly identified in the

is 2.6' SW.  Located 10.7' NE of N7720 in AGC 2634.  N7728 lies 11' E and CGCG 476-095 11' 
NW.  The identification of this galaxy with N7726 (a Swift discovery) is uncertain although the 
RNGC has certainly misidentified the number with IC 5342 which lies 2.4' SE of N7720.

Discovered by Lewis Swift on 8 Aug 1886 within the rich galaxy cluster Abell 2634.  His 
discovery position is 23 37 00 +26 42 36 (1950) or 14' ESE of N7720, the brightest member of 
the cluster.

Not found by Bigourdan and there is no object near his position and the RNGC has misidentified 
N7726 with IC 5342 = CGCG 476-092 which was discovered by Howe and correctly placed at 
23 36 08 +26 44.1 (1950).  This galaxy is one of the several very close companions of N7720 
and lies just 2.4' SE.

As a more plausible candidate, Harold Corwin has suggested N7726 = U12721 = MCG +04-55-
040 = CGCG 476-098 at 23 36 41.4 +26 50 18 (1950) which is closer to Swift's position.  This 
identification is uncertain, though, as Swift mentions a "pB* nr f" and the mag 9 star is actually 
9' following altlhough Swift mentioned that N7728 is north-following which does match 
U12721.

In any case, the RNGC identification is certainly incorrect.  I described this object as nonexistent 
in RNGC Corrections #4.  Relisted in RNGC Corrections #6.  See NGCBUGS.

Discovered by Stone (I).  His position is given roughly with the declination uncertain and RA to 
the nearest minute and is 1.5 tmin W (typical error) and 10' N of M-02-60-022 (PA matches).  
Howe felt that Stone's N7776 might be identical to N7761 whose position is also incorrect.  M-
02-60-022 is located 2.7 tmin following M-02-60-020 = N7761 which matches Stone's relative

17.5" (12/20/95): scattered group of two dozen stars in a 10' diameter mostly N and E of mag 6.5 
HD 224404.  Most stars are mag 11-13 (with one brighter mag 9.5 star) and only a few faint 
members.  There are two mag 9 stars 4' and 6' S of the mag 6.5 star but these are really detached 
from the group.  The brighter mag 11 stars form a boxy outline and there is circular hole void of 
stars in the center.  Only noticeable because of the mag 6.5 star and the group is somewhat 
detached in the field but appears to be an asterism at 100x and 220x.  This group is 1.0 tmin 
preceding John Herschel's position. Listed as nonexistent in RNGC.

Discovered by JH (h2287): "A star 7m, the chief of a vL coarse scattered but poor cl which fills

This erroneous NGC entry is from Schweizer (Observations de Moscou, II, 115).  But in four 
observations Engelhardt could only see a double star without nebulosity  and the region was 
carefully examined by Burnham (Publ of Lick Obs, II) on two nights and only a faint pair was 
found: "but there was no trace of nebulosity about it, or anywhere in the vicinity."  He measured 
the separation (1891) as 9.8" in PA 55.6°.

17.5" (8/25/95): very faint, very large nebulosity best viewed in the 16x80 finder as it gives a 
higher contrast with the surrounding sky.  Appears elongated E-W and at least 40' in size.  At 
82x, nebulosity is clearly visible in the region of a triangle of mag 8-9 stars including mag 7.9 
SAO 20996 at 00 00 57.5 +68 27 27 (2000).  A large portion of the field appears weakly 
nebulous, though not with certainty.  The identification of John Herschel's NGC 8722 is 
uncertain and may apply to Ced 214 about 1.5 degrees to the south (description below).

17.5" (10/4/97): Ced 214 was not detected unfiltered at 82x or using an OIII filter.  With an H-
Beta filter, a 40' field surrounding the mag 5.7 illuminating star appeared weakly nebulous in 
contrast to the immediate periphery.  No structure noted, although seemed roughly circular.  The 
small open cluster Be 59 is embedded on the NW side.  This object may be N7822 if John 
Herschel made a 1.5 degree error in declination.

00 05 17 -20 41.5

17.5" (12/4/93): about 20 scattered mag 9-13 stars in a 15' diameter form this asterism.  Most of 
the stars are arranged in an elongated string oriented NNW-SSE including five brighter mag 9-10 
stars.  A double star (mag 10/11.5 at 30" in pa 45°) located 10' E forms an equilateral triangle 
with the endpoints of the string.  Stands out in field because of the brighter stars.  Listed as a 
nonexistent cluster in the RNGC, though visible on the DSS.

14 star is at the SW end 45" from center.  Located 2.2' NNW of mag 8.9 SAO 53654.  Identified 
in the UGC and CGCG as IC 1530.

Discovered by Swift (II).  His position is 62 tsec W and 8' S of U00060 = M+05-01-032 = 
CGCG 498-078.  This is a similar offset as N19, N21 and N7836 all discovered on 20 Sept 1885.  
Furthermore, his description of a "B* s[outh]" matches mag 8.9 SAO 53654 located 2.2' S and 
"vF* v nr" matches a mag 14 star at the SW end 45" from center, so the identification is certain.

Bigourdan could not find this galaxy at Swift's position but reobserved it, assuming it was a 
discovery and it also received the number IC 1530 and the correct place.  

CGCG, UGC, MCG identify this galaxy as IC 1530. See Catalogue Corrections, Thomson and 
NGCBUGS.  GSC position 00 07 19.5 +32 36 35 (2000).

a stellar or quasi-stellar knot.  Located 4' NE of N7837/7838 and 5' NNW of NGC 3. Incorrectly 
listed as nonexistent in the RNGC.

Discovered by Marth in 1864 as part of a small group of galaxies including NGC's 7830, 7834, 
7835, 7837, 7838, 3, 4.  With the exception of N7830 which is mostly likely a star, the other 
members have been identified with faint galaxies.  N7840 is listed as nonexistent in RNGC.  

Corwin identifies a likely candidate at 00 07 08.9 +08 23 00 (2000).  This extremely faint galaxy 
is less than 3' S of Marth's position.  Although I missed viewing this galaxy in my 17.5" it was 
likely visible to Marth using Lassell's 48" equatorial.   First discussed in personal correspondence 
with Corwin on 7/18/86.  Listed in RNGC Corrections #2.  This galaxy is listed in LEDA as 
PGC 1345780.
