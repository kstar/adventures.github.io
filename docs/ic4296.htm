<H3>-by Steve Gottlieb</H3><P>

The IC 4296 group (Abell 3565) resides in northern Centaurus, just four
degrees south of M83. The brightest member, IC 4296 (V = 10.6) is a giant
elliptical radio galaxy and dominates the 30 or so members. Deep images
reveal it is interacting with IC 4299 6' SSE. Both of these galaxies were
discovered by Lewis Swift using a 16" refractor in southern California on
December 30, 1897. John Herschel had earlier visited the cluster from the
Cape of Good Hope in the 1830's but only picked up two fainter members, NGC
5215 and NGC 5220 (itself a close interacting pair).<P>

If you observe this group, make sure to check out the <A HREF="ic4329.htm">IC 4329 cluster</A> (Abell
3574), about four degrees northeast. At the western edge of the cluster is
the interacting, distorted pair NGC 5291 and MCG -5-33-5, better known as the
"Seashell" galaxy for its "whelk" like appearance. Deep photographs reveal
plumes of material extending from the tidal disturbance stretching some
600,000 light years!<P>

The following observing notes for the IC 4296 group were made on 21 April
2001 from our favorite observing site near Fiddletown, California with my
17.5" at 220x and 280x. Nine cluster members were picked up within a 50'
circle.<P>
