<center><h3>NGC 6166 = ARC 2199<br>

16 28 38.4 +39 33 05</h3></center>



This is a giant "cD" galaxy at the center of the rich cluster Abell 2199. By

itself, this galaxy is unremarkable visually - I recorded it as "fairly faint

and small, elongated 4:3 SW-NE, broad concentration." What is remarkable is

the surrounding halo of extremely faint galaxies. Within a 5' circle I viewed

6 extremely small and faint companions swarming like bees around NGC 6166!!

How many of these dim companions can you view? N6166A 2.3' SW, N6166B 2.9' E,

N6166C 3.1' NW, N6166D 2.0' S, MCG +7-34-64 4.8' SSE and an anonymous galaxy

just off the south edge of N6166.<p><hr><p>

18 01 49 -27 49.6</h3>

<img src="images/dj2.jpg" width=50%><p></center><p>



Discovered photographically on the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Sky

Survey, E456-SC38 was reclassified as a globular by Djorgovski in 1987.based

on a CMD (color-magnitude diagram. What's particularly interesting is the

location - just 21' WNW of NGC 6520/B86! (one of the most prominent dark

nebulae in the sky). At 140x, E456-SC38 showed up as a faint, oval glow

~1.5'x1.1' with no hint of resolution other than one or two faint stars

glimpsed at the edges. At 220-280x, it appeared oriented SW-NE and stands out

well with averted vision with a fairly sharp outline but appeared more like a

faint patch of nebulosity than a globular. A few mag 15+ field stars were

visible at the edges - the easiest at the SW end and a second star at the NE

edge. One of two other threshold stars are superimposed.<p>



The rich milky way background is quite prominent in the field except in the

vicinity of the globular which appears nestled in a darker "hole" defined by

four brighter stars. The globular is sandwiched within a small trapezoid

defined by a mag 9 star to the south, a close double star 2.5' NNW and two

mag 10 stars bracket the cluster on the west and east sides.<p><hr><p>

18 24 58.5 +00 51 38</h3></center>



This huge planetary has listed dimensions of 475"x330"! Nothing was visible

unfiltered, but using an OIII filter at 100x, Sh 2-68 appeared as a very

large, round, low surface brightness glow, perhaps 5'-6' in diameter. It

required averted vision but the halo had a fairly crisp edge and surface

brightness was uniform. This is a recent 1983 discovery and is possibly a HII

region.<p><hr><p>

<img src="images/sh2-71.jpg" width=50%><p></center>





This object is an unusually prominent obscure planetary and was !immediately

picked up at 100x using an OIII filter Probably the best view was filtered at

140x and it was seen as a fairly large glow, elongated N-S and brightest

along the east side. I had the impression it was mottled with a noticeably

irregular surface brightness. You will find this nebula 6' following a mag 10

star and several mag 11-12 stars are nearby.<p><hr><p>

<center><h3>Arp 2<br>

19 28 44.1 -30 21 14</h3>
<img src="images/arp2.jpg" width=50%><p></center>





Arp 2 is one of four globulars (along with Terzan 7, 8 and M54) that may be

associated with the recently discovered nearby Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal

Galaxy (Sgr dSph ) which was discovered in 1994. This might explain an

apparent anomaly - it appears roughly 3 billion years younger than typical

metal-poor Milky Way globulars.<p>



Not much is visible in my 17.5-inch: Arp 2 appeared as an extremely low

surface brightness glow with a very small brighter core, perhaps 2' diameter,

situated in a rich star field. At moments, a faint star or knot was visible

at the center. A distinctive 1.5' clump of five faint stars 5.5' NNE provides

a good reference to center the globular.<p><hr><p>

<img src="images/par21.jpg" width=50%><p>
</center>



This object is classified as a cometary nebula - apparently a bipolar

reflection nebula with a single visible "tail". At 280x I picked up a faint,

round, 15" knot, roughly mag 13.5. It appeared brighter in the center but no

clear central star was visible. This nebulosity is situated on a line between

a mag 8.2 star 5' ENE and a mag 11.5 star 4' WSW. I didn't pick up any sign

of the "tail" visible on images - let us know if you can pick it up!<p><hr><p>

<img src="images/hick87.jpg" width=50%><p></center><p>



This spectacular Hickson Compact Group was voted as a favorite HST image in a

public web poll! The Hubble telescope reveals the brightest member (ESO

597-G36) is an edge-on with a prominent dust lane. With my 17.5-inch, though,

it was pretty faint, fairly small, elongated SW-NE, 0.9'x0.3', with a very

low even surface brightness. A mag 14/15 double star at 13" separation lies

1' NW. A close companion (HCG 87B) is collinear with the major axis close off

the SW end. Can anyone make out the dust lane visible on the HST image?<p><hr><p>

<center><h3>Elephant's Trunk Nebula = vdB 142<br>

21 36 41 +57 30.1</h3>

<img src="images/sh2131.jpg" width=50%><p></center><p>



The "Elephant's Trunk" is an unusual cometary globule (associated with star

formation) on the west side of the huge but faint HII complex, IC 1396. This

is a tough object and requires transparent skies and lots of patience! The

most contrasty view was at 100x using a UHC filter, where a 15'x5' lane was

evident oriented WSW-ENE, particularly by gently rocking my scope back and

forth. The "tail" of the globule or elephant's "trunk" heads west and is

weakly illuminated on the edges, particularly on the south side. Near the

"head" is a mag 9 star (SAO 33573) and a pretty double star to the west was

embedded in the lane. With careful viewing the "trunk" shows variations in

width and opacity.<p>
