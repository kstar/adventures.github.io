Hickson 57 in Leo is better known as "Copeland's Septet" and was discovered on
February 9, 1874 by Ralph Copeland, an assistant on Lord Rosse's 72-inch.
This challenging group consists of 7 NGC galaxies (3745, 3746, 3748, 3750,
3751, 3753, 3754) contained within a 5' circle and requires a 10"-12.5"
scope for a decent view.  Unfortunately, Copeland confused the field with a
nearby area containing two faint galaxies (NGC 3743 and 3758) and reduced
the positions using the wrong reference stars. In compiling the NGC in
1888, Dreyer used these incorrect positions and this later resulted in the
RNGC classifying the entire group as nonexistent!  More recent catalogues
and atlases list Copeland's Septet at the correct position.<p>

NGC 3753 is the brightest member of Hickson #57 at 13.6V.  In my 17.5-inch
I logged it as "faint, fairly small, elongated 5:2 WNW-ESE, containing a
bright core."  NGC 3750 is a faint companion (13.9V) just 0.7' southwest
that simply appears as a very small, round knot.  Even dimmer is NGC 3754
situated just off the northeast end of NGC 3753.  A second close trio is
located about 3' northwest.  The brightest of these three, NGC 3746, glows
dimly at 14.2V and although photographs reveal a barred spiral, I only
noted a very small, round, featureless spot.  Two faint glimmers, NGC 3745
and NGC 3748, were barely visible 1' north and 2' northeast, respectively.
Finally, less than 3' south of NGC 3753 is NGC 3751, comparable in
difficulty to the two companions of NGC 3746.<p>

While examining the field of Copeland's Septet with my 17.5-inch I was
surprised to pick up an 8th galaxy- UGC 6601- located 11' south of NGC
3753.  According to my log, this object appeared "very faint, small, oval
3:2 north-south with a gradually brighter core." An eighth magnitude star
3' south hinders the view.  This group requires a great deal of effort but
it's a very rewarding feeling if you can knock off the entire Septet. - Steve Gottlieb<p>
