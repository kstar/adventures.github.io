    <h2><x-dso>IC 4406</x-dso> in Lupus<br>
    14h22.4m -44d09'</h2>
  </center>13: this bipolar PN appeared fairly bright and prominent using a Daystar 300 filter although from Northern California the viewing elevation was very low! Under these conditions, IC
  4406 appeared as a fairly small smooth disc, roughly 35" in diameter and E-W extensions were not seen. No central star was seen at 214x although a mag 13.5 star was visible just off the
  west edge. - Steve Gottlieb
  <p>From further south, this is a real showpiece! Through a friend's 20-incher at the Texas Star Party, it had a mottled texture and a peculiar boxy shape, like a coffin, with squared
  corners and 3:1 E-W elongation. - Jim Shields</p>

    <h2><x-dso>NGC 6210</x-dso> in Hercules<br>
    16h44.5m +23d48'</h2>
  </center>17.5" (5/27/00): beautiful bluish oval at 220x, elongated 4:3 E-W, 0.4'x0.3'. At 380x, there appears to be a very small fainter halo. At 500x, the narrow outer envelope is more
  evident and is elongated in the direction of the major axis, increasing the size to ~30"x20".
  <p>13: very bright, extremely high surface brightness, blue, takes very high power. Mag 12.5 central star not seen.</p>

    <h2>Minkowski's Butterfly (<x-dso>M2</x-dso>-9) in Ophiuchus<br>
    17h05.6m -10d09'</h2>
  </center>17.5: picked up a low power but best viewed at 380x. The faint central star is cleanly resolved with two thin "jets" extending N-S, roughly 15" on either side of the star. The
  nebulosity dims slightly near the central star but is not detached. This unusual bi-polar object looks more similar to a fairly faint edge-on galaxy than a PN although the tips of the
  extensions do not noticeably taper. No response to filtration.
  <p>13: at 166x appears as a moderately bright, very elongated planetary but does not respond positively to OIII or Daystar 300 filters! The central star is visible at 214x. A small group of
  stars including a mag 12 star lies 5' S. Classified as a bipolar PN or possible proto-PN. - Steve Gottlieb</p>
  <p>17.5: this bi-polar proto-planetary is the subject of an amazing Hubble image. This is a showpiece object in a larger scope, with a surprising amount of structure visible. The bright
  central star is separated from its two flame-like jets by darker gaps. - Jim Shields</p>

    <h2>Bug Nebula (<x-dso>NGC 6302</x-dso>) in Scorpius<br>
    17d13.8m -37d06'</h2>
  </center>17.5" (6/30/00): at 280x (unfiltered) the Bug Nebula is a remarkable, high surface brightness object, elongated 3:1 WSW-ENE, ~2.0x0.7'. The intensely bright 10" core appears
  elongated SW-NE and is offset to the east of center. A quasi-stellar nucleus sharpens to a stellar point when the seeing steadies. The western wing is longer and is nearly split at the
  midpoint by a dark slash oriented N-S with a brighter condensation at the west end. The shorter eastern wing is more pinched and just past its midpoint there is a kink and it angles towards
  the SE.
  <p>13: bright, fairly small, elongated E-W, very high surface brightness. Subtle structure but the western extension is notably longer, brighter and cut by a dark lane. The eastern
  extension bends slightly N just E of center.</p>

    <h2>Cheerio Nebula (<x-dso>NGC 6337</x-dso>) in Scorpius<br>
    17h22.3m -38d29'</h2>
  </center>17.5" (6/30/00): very pretty annular PN at 280x, ~45" and set in a rich star field. A mag 12 star is superimposed on the inner edge of the NE rim and an extremely faint star is
  symmetrically placed at the SW edge. The darker hole is 20"-25" diameter and perfectly circular. The outer rim appears irregularly lit.
  <p>13: at 166x with a UHC filter appears fairly faint, fairly small, roundish. Slightly darker center (annular) with averted vision although low contrast with rim. No central star seen.</p>

  <center>
    <h2><x-dso>NGC 6369</x-dso> in Ophiuchus<br>
    17h29.3m -23d46'</h2>
  </center>17.5" (6/30/00): at 500x the "Little Gem Nebula" has a beautiful annular appearance with a 25-30" halo perforated by a 12" dark hole. The northern rim is noticeably brighter with a
  nearly stellar spot near its center.
  <p>13: beautiful ring at 214x and UHC filter, small, slightly elongated. The N edge of the rim appears brighter.</p>

    <h2><x-dso simbad="Sh2-2">Sharpless 2</x-dso>-71 in Aquila<br>
    19h02m+02d09'</h2>
  </center>17.5" (8/21/98): immediately picked up at 100x with an OIII filter. This object is an unusually prominent obscure planetary! The best view was at 140x using an OIII filter. Appears
  fairly large, elongated N-S and brightest along the east side. Seems mottled with a noticeably irregular surface brightness.
  <p>13": at 79x with OIII filter; fairly faint, fairly large, oval N-S, can hold steadily with direct vision. Appears relatively bright for an obscure planetary. Located 6' E of a mag 10
  star and several mag 11-12 stars are near.</p>

    <h2><x-dso>NGC 6781</x-dso> in Aquila<br>
    19h18.5m +06d32'</h2>
  </center>17.5" (6/30/00): at 220x unfiltered this fairly bright PN has a 1.5' round halo. The rim is brightest and more well-defined along an arc on the S and SE rim. The central 45" hole
  is slightly darker and irregular in surface brightness. A mag 13 star is at the NE edge and once or twice I caught a fainter glimmer of an interior star north of center.
  <p>17.5" (7/12/99): at 100x appears fairly bright, round, ~1.6' diameter with a darker center. I used a variety of magnifications and filters but the most interesting view was at 220x using
  a UHC filter. With this combination the PN is slightly elongated E-W and clearly brighter along the southern rim with the brightening tapering towards the ends so this brighter portion had
  a crescent appearance. Because of this asymmetric rim the darker center seems offset and only weakly brightens at the NW rim. A mag 13 star is just off the NE edge 1' from center.</p>
  <p>13: brighter rim mainly on the SW side, slightly annular appearance. A faint star is off the E edge.</p>

    <h2>Blue Flash Nebula (<x-dso>NGC 6905</x-dso>) in Delphinus<br>
    20h22.4m +20d06'</h2>
  </center>17.5: very pretty planetary at 280x. Fairly bright, fairly small, slightly elongated. A very faint central star (V = 15.7) is visible. Takes 440x well. Just off the N edge is a mag
  11 star 1.4' from center and a mag 12 star is just off the S edge 39" from center.
  <p>8: moderately bright, uniform, slightly elongated N-S, two stars at the NE and S edge.</p>

    <h2><x-dso simbad="PN A66 70">Abell 70</x-dso> in Aquila<br>
    20h31.6m-07d05'</h2>
  </center>17.5" (8/12/96): picked up without problem at 100x using an OIII filter as a 40" disc with a brighter streak running along the N side. Visible without filter but the streak and
  disc are dimmer to view. Seen well without filter at 220x where the disc is a bit more prominent but still brighter along the N side.
  <p>17.5" (7/31/92): easily visible at 100x using an OIII filter and can hold steadily with direct vision. Fairly faint, fairly small, almost round, 30" diameter, estimate V = 14.0-14.3.
  Visible without filter using averted vision. At 220x viewed without filter; faint, fairly small, appears to be brighter along the N side, edges not as crisp using this higher power. The
  brightening detected along the N edge of the rim at 220x is assumed to be a very faint anonymous galaxy shining through the planetary.</p>

  <center>
    <h2><x-dso>NGC 7008</x-dso> in Cygnus<br>
    21h00.5m +54d33'</h2>
  </center>17.5" (6/28/00): this beautiful, highly structured PN is situated just north of a wide double star (9.3/10.2 at 18"). At 280x, the annular oval is elongated SSW-NNE, ~90"x65". A
  bright 30" irregular knot is prominent at the NE end. The SW end of the major axis has a fainter condensation and the rim is clearly dimmest near the double star. The mag 14 central star
  shines steadily as a does a slightly fainter mag 14.5 on the NE edge. Just off the W edge is another 14th magnitude star. The darker center is faintly luminous and the surface brightness is
  irregular over the entire oval giving a mottled, wispy appearance.
  <p>13: bright planetary with unusual structure and several stars involved. The striking complete annular ring is elongated SW-NE. A mag 14 central star mag is visible as well as a mag 14
  star at the NE edge and a faint star is off the W edge. A small brighter knot marks the ENE end. The planetary is located just N of h1606 = 9.3/10.2 at 18" separation.</p>
  <p>8: unusual structure, curves S on the W side. A faint star is embedded.</p>

    <h2><x-dso>IC 5148</x-dso> in Grus<br>
    21h59.6m -39d23'</h2>
  </center>17.5 (10/30/99): Even at -39Â° declination, this moderately large planetary is a beautiful annular ring at 100x with an OIII filter. Appears round, ~100" diameter, the annulus has
  an irregular surface brightness. The central "hole" is perhaps 25" in diameter and fairly dark. A mag 10.5 star is close off the SSW edge.
  <p>13: fairly faint with OIII at 79x, fairly large. A mag 11 star is off the S edge, clearly annular with averted vision. Possible central hole elongated N-S.</p>
