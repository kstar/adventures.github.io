Barnard's Galaxy or NGC
6822 is a small irregular galaxy only 14 degrees  east of the
galactic plane in the constellation of Sagittarius. A member of
the Local Group of Galaxies, it is quite similar to the Small
Magellanic Cloud in composition and structure. Though it has a
fairly low surface brightness, NGC 6822 is one of the easiest
galaxies to resolve. Numerous H II regions and bright supergiant
stars can be resolved with only a 20cm telescope equipped with
a CCD camera. Several large H II regions and the brightest stars
are visible in large aperture telescopes under dark skies.<P>

Today the galaxy is under intense scrutiny and has
been the subject of numerous papers over the last thirty years.
However the past observational history has been much more colorful.
The low surface brightness of the galaxy itself combined with
the relatively bright H II regions has lead to a great deal of
confusion over its identity during the late 19th to early 20th
centuries. The unique observational history of Barnard's Galaxy
will be covered in much more detail in the next section of the
paper.<p>

<CENTER><h3>Historical Observations</h3></CENTER>
<P>
<B>1) Early Work</B>
<P>
The early observations
of NGC 6822 are quite interesting and rather confused, representative
of conditions under which the object was observed. NGC 6822 is
a large, low surface brightness object and is best viewed  at
low magnification for maximum contrast of field. Barnard's early
observations certainly reflect the challenging nature of this
object. Barnard first observed the galaxy on August 17, 1884 with
a 5-inch refractor. He described the object as.. &quot;an excessively
faint nebula&quot; and &quot;it is some 2' in diameter, and is
very diffuse and even in its light&quot; (Barnard, 1884).  He
later determined its position with a 6-inch equatorial and noted
it was &quot;seen with difficulty&quot;, while in the 5-inch at
30x it was &quot;quite distinct&quot;. In 1885, he examined it
again with a 6-inch refractor and a &quot;comet&quot; eyepiece.
The wide field boosted the visibility of the galaxy, and Barnard
made a most <I>unusual</I> observation (Hubble, 1925): 
<P>
<I>It certainly seems much larger and much denser
than last year and I certainly think it has increased in density
and size since that time...If it had always been as large and
bright as now, I cannot conceive how it could have been missed
by observers when examining G.C. 4510 (the bright planetary nebula
NGC 6818, which is about 40' north preceding). Probably this is
a variable nebula. </I>
<P>
The problems associated
with observing NGC 6822 will plague many observers over the next
40 years. Hubble in 1925 writes: <I>NGC 6822 is fairly conspicuous
in a short 4-inch finder...but is barely discernible at the primary
focus of the 100-inch </I>(Hubble, 1925; Burnham, 1977). Large
refractors with their restrictive field of view were particularly
ill-suited for the study of this low contrast object. The 26-inch
at Leander McCormick Observatory completely missed the galaxy,
instead the two brightest H II regions located on the north end
of the galaxy were observed. The brighter of the two diffuse nebulae
was assumed to be NGC 6822, while the fainter received the designation
of IC 1308 (Hubble, 1925).
<P>
Even photography did not quickly resolve the discrepancies
between Barnard's original observations and those made with much
larger telescopes. Max Wolf at the Heidelberg Observatory photographed
the region in 1906 and 1907. Wolf, using the 16-inch Bruce Camera
and the 28.5-inch Walz Reflector identified the two largest diffuse
nebulae as NGC 6822 and IC 1308. Wolf also noted a dense region
of small clusters and nebulae (Wolf, 1907; Hubble, 1925). The
&quot;new&quot; object was actually the main bar of the galaxy,
now well resolved into stars and nebulae. It received the designation
of IC 4895, and once again Barnard's original observations were
overlooked.  It took 15 years  before  Perrine  (1922) of the
Cordoba Observatory, Argentina, finally resolved the discrepancies
in identification and interpretation. Perrine correctly identified
that the diffuse nebulae and Wolf's group of small clusters were
all part of the same system. He was the first to recognize its
true nature as an extragalactic system. Perrine properly classified
NGC 6822 as a Magellenic Cloud-type  object. This helped cleared
the way for Edwin Hubble's groundbreaking work in 1925. <p>


<B>2) Hubble's 1925 Paper</B>
<P>
 Edwin Hubble's 1925 paper:  <I>N.G.C. 6822, A Remote
Stellar System</I> remains as one of the great classical studies
of the early 20th century.  The galaxy's resemblance to the Magellenic
Clouds led to intensive study by the large reflectors of the time.
He conducted a detailed survey of the structure and stellar population
of this system. Hubble discovered 15 variable stars (11 Cepheids),
measured the distribution of stars down to magnitude 19.4, and
described five &quot;diffuse nebulae&quot; (giant H II regions)
plus determine the absolute magnitude of the entire system. 
<P>
 Hubble's discovery of eleven Cepheid variables
was one of the most important milestones in galactic astronomy.
Using the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relationship, Barnard's Galaxy
became the first system beyond the Magellenic Clouds to have its
distance determined (Hubble will soon follow suit with M31 and
M33). He derived a distance of 214,000 parsecs, or over 700,000
light years, far beyond  Harlow Shapley's 300,000 light years
as the size of known universe. In one paper, Hubble resolved the
&quot;Great Debate&quot; of 1920 between Curtis and Shapley over
the scale of the universe and the nature of the &quot;spiral nebulae&quot;.
It soon became clear that all spiral nebulae were galaxies far
beyond our own.<p>

<B>1) The Structure - Modern Studies</B>
<p>
 After Hubble's 1925 paper, detailed research on
NGC 6822 stagnated for nearly 50 years. Starting in the late 1960's
through the present, considerable research has been conducted
on the structure and content of this galaxy. Some of the most
important properties of NGC 6822 are summarized in Table One.

<I>Overall Structure:</I> Barnard's Galaxy consists of a &quot;bright&quot;
central bar embedded in a broad oval halo of lower surface brightness.
The bar has a position angle of 10<SUP>o</SUP>  3<SUP>o</SUP>
and a mean ellipticity of 0.47  0.18 (Hodge, 1977). There are
two main extensions of luminosity off the ends of the central
bar. The brightest extends towards the west off the north end.
It includes one of the brightest H II regions (= Hubble V) plus
two bright OB associations (Hodge, 1977). The other extension
sweeps to the southeast off the southern portion of the bar. It
is much larger, though fainter and lacks the large, bright H II
regions associated with the northern end of the galaxy. A large
stellar association is located near the southeastern terminus.
The bar is surrounded by a broad outer halo. Based on photographic
photometry, the halo is much larger than most published dimensions,
measuring at least ~ 15' by 10'. Several OB associations and the
bright H II regions of Hubble I+III and II are located in the
northwest section of the halo. <BR>
<P>
<I>Stars and Stellar Associations: </I>The open structure and
relative closeness of NGC 6822 allow for easy resolution into
stars. Hodge <I>et al.</I> (1991) conducted a survey of deep Schmidt
plates in four colors to determine the stellar population of the
galaxy. After removing foreground stars from our galaxy, they
found over 360 stars brighter than <I>M<SUB>v</SUB>  </I>= - 6.5,
or magnitude 18.0. Over one hundred stars have magnitudes in the
range of 13.5 to 16.5, well within range of larger amateur telescopes.
<P>
 Most of the brighter stars are concentrated in the northern portion
of the bar and in the large OB associations. Hodge (1977) described
16 separate OB associations. These are located along the bar and
the two main extensions, plus in other regions of higher star
density. Characteristics of the brighter OB associations are outlined
in Table 2. Many of the larger associations are also integrated
into giant H II regions. All five Hubble H II regions incorporate
a large OB association (Table 2). <BR>

<I>H II Regions: </I>The H II regions are perhaps the most thoroughly
studied component of the galaxy.  Hubble (1925) studied the five
brightest regions, two of which had been discovered over 30 years
earlier and misclassified as IC 1308 and NGC 6822.  He was the
first to determine their spectral characteristics, luminousities
and dimensions. In 1977, Hodge increased the number of known 
H II regions to 16. Today over 150 are catalogued. Most of these
objects are very small and faint and not observable in amateur
telescopes. Table 3 summarizes the five brightest objects that
are visible large aperture amateur telescopes. Another table (Table
4) summarizing the properties of a few faint nebulae of Killen
and Dufour (1982) can be found in appendix 2. <p>

<B>2) Making Visual Observations of Barnard's Galaxy</B>
<P>
 Gradually over the past thirty years Barnard's Galaxy has emerged
from relative obscurity to become a target for amateur telescopes.
Although not in any popular list of deepsky objects, several good
observing handbooks have fairly detailed descriptions of the galaxy.
Two Webb Society Deep-Sky Observer's Handbooks (DSOH): <I>Galaxies</I>
(Vol. 4) and <I>The Southern Sky</I> (Vol. 7) contains observations
of the galaxy, while <I>Galaxies </I>has a detailed chart in appendix.
Other good descriptions can be found in Hartung's 1968 classic:
<I>Astronomical Objects for Southern Telescopes</I> and Luginbuhl
and Skiff (1989) <I>Observing Handbook and Catalogue of Deep-Sky
Objects. </I>These provide good, general descriptions of the galaxy
and the most prominent features.
<P>
  In the last section of this paper, I will review some of the
best observations from these guidebooks, plus submissions from
several experienced observers of the Webb Society. I will also
include some of my own observations whenever appropriate. Instruments
used will range from the humble binocular up to large telescopes
of the 50cm class.<BR>
<P>
<I><B>Binocular Observations: </B></I>
<P>
 One of the biggest surprises I had uncovered was that Barnard's
Galaxy is a &quot;binocular object&quot; and a fairly easy one
at that. Jay Reynolds Freeman, an experienced observer from the
&quot;Bay Area&quot;  of California, USA was describing his observations
of the galaxy on the <I>Usenet</I> forum <I>sci.astro.amateur.
</I>He was<I> </I>using 11 x 80mm and 10 x 50mm binoculars. I
was <I>amazed</I>, as it had never occurred to me that  NGC 6822
was visible in anything smaller than a 4-inch richfield telescope.
<P>
 I then contacted Brian Skiff inquiring if he had made similar
observations. He wrote that he was able to <I>detect</I> the galaxy
with only a 7 x 35mm binoculars, while a larger 10 x 50mm model
easily revealed a faint smudge elongated north-south. These observations
were carried out under fairly dark (visual magnitude ~ 6.5) skies.
The relatively bright visual magnitude combined with large size
make this galaxy a good challenge for binoculars. The sharp, high-contrast
image in good quality  binoculars has greatly expanded the &quot;list&quot;
of viewable deep-sky objects. <BR>
<P>
<I><B>Richfield Telescopes:</B></I> 
<P>
 Small, short focal length &quot;richfield&quot; telescopes are
often the instrument of choice for general study of the galaxy.
Wide, low power fields combined with sharp optics are ideal in
revealing the low contrast bar and its orientation. With my 15cm
f/5 reflector at 29x and 43x (L<SUB>m</SUB> (visual) ~ 5.5 in
the area, 6.5 at zenith), I could easily see the a broad, diffuse
oval glow gradually brightening in the area of the central bar.
The galaxy was aligned nearly north-south, and set in a relatively
rich star field. Some slight mottling was visible, but no other
structural details were apparent. Observations with an 8 1/2-inch
in the DSOH #4 and #7 reveal few details other than:..<I>still
very faint but seems to be comprised of 3 distinct but connected
regions.</I> Observations of the various structures in NGC 6822
requires both larger aperture and considerably higher magnifications.
<BR>
<P>
<I><B>Moderate to Large Aperture Telescopes</B>:</I> 
<P>
 To fully appreciate all the structural diversity that Barnard's
Galaxy has to offer,  moderate to large sized (&gt; 30 cm) telescopes
under dark skies are best. I have gathered observations from several
well-known deep-sky observers and have included a few of my own
observations. Jeff Corder, Steve Gottlieb, Tom Polakis and Brian
Skiff have made detailed observations of the H II regions and
the &quot;bar&quot; of the galaxy. My observations are with the
Atlanta Astronomy Club's 50cm f/4.5, and include observations
of the bar, H II regions and a couple OB associations. Of all
the structures in the galaxy, the H II regions are the brightest
and most easily visible. <BR>

<P>
<B>Observations of the &quot;Bar&quot;</B>
<P>
 The central bar of the galaxy is easy to observe, but descriptions
of structural details have been elusive. Broad, low contrast variations
have been noted but little else have been recorded.  Most of the
galaxy's brightest stars are concentrated along the bar and there
have been several convincing observations of <I>partial</I> resolution.
Of the probable +100 hundred  galaxy member stars brighter than
magnitude 16.5, most are concentrated in the northern end of the
bar (Hodge <I>et al., </I>1991). Some interesting observations
of resolution are given here:

of ~ 15 magnitude and fainter; these are mostly concentrated in
the northern end of the central bar. Some obvious clumping visible,
including OB Association<I> Hodge 9</I> was visible as a diffuse
patch with a few scattered ~16 mag. stars. <br>

 Obviously, the key to detailed study of this elusive
object is to maximize light gathering efficiency and higher magnification.
Low magnification is all too often stressed and although it will
reveal the general shape of the galaxy, small structures as the
H II regions may be overlooked. Don't be afraid to use higher
magnification on the order of 3 to 5x /cm or more! The galaxy
may actually fade from view at higher magnifications. Generally,
the small, higher surface brightness features will be better seen.
Suggested minimum size for detailed study is at least 30 cm, and
40cm or more is recommended for partial resolution of the  bar
and OB associations.
<P>
 Many of the fainter H II regions have yet to be
observed (Table 4) along with the brighter OB associations. There
are also four open clusters discovered by Hubble that have photometric
magnitudes brighter than 17.5 (Hodge, 1977). These objects would
make an interesting challenge for owners of very large telescopes,
or those equipped with CCD setups. Even a modest telescope equipped
with a good CCD can easily resolve this galaxy into stars making
it practical for nova  patrols to be conducted. So after hundred
years of observation, Barnard's Galaxy remains an interesting
challenge for amateurs and professionals alike.
