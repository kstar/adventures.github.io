          This central <a href="https://calstar.observers.org">California star 
          party</a> took place over 4 nights, September 25-28, at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_San_Antonio">Lake 
          San Antonio</a>. Although the site is located in a <a href="http://www.cleardarksky.com/lp/Lake_San_Antoniolp.html?Mn=optics">dark 
          blue light pollution zone</a> transparency seemed a bit off from previous 
          years (perhaps due to nearby developments). Still SQM readings were 
          typically between 21.4-21.5, plenty dark to explore faint fuzzies with 
          my 24-inch f/3.7 Starstructure. The skies were totally clear on the 
          first and last nights, but on the other two a deep marine layer of clouds 
          (3500&#146;) pushed onshore over the coastal mountains and we were clouded 
          out by midnight. 
          <p>My targets included a variety of solar system objects (such as Comet 
            Africano C/2018 W2 and Neptune/Triton) and Milky Way highlights, but 
            mostly focused on small galaxy groups that abound in the Fall skies. 
            Most of the following descriptions were made at 322x or 375x, except 
            for the first field, which required a low power.</p>
          <p>Next year&#146;s star party will take place on April 23-26th, though 
            there is no sign-up required or star party fees (other than the LSA 
            camping fee) and participants can arrive or leave outside these dates.<br>

          NGC 6726, NGC 6727, NGC 6729, Bernes 157<br>

        </p>
        <p align="left">Early on the first evening of the star party I took a 
          look at the remarkable field that includes the showpiece globular cluster 
          NGC 6723, south of the Teapot (Sagittarius). Even at a southerly declination 
          of -36.6&deg;, this 7th magnitude globular was well resolved. To the 
          southeast (over the Corona Australis border) is a group of three bright 
          reflection nebula - NGC 6726, 6727 and 6729. Of course, these objects 
          are much more prominent &#151; top showpieces, in fact &#151; from the 
          southern hemisphere. Nevertheless, they are well worth a look from the 
          latitude of central California.</p>
        <p>These bright reflection nebulae are only 30' from NGC 6723, yet for 
          some reason they were missed by John Herschel during his southern survey 
          from the Cape of Good Hope. A large aperture is certainly not necessary 
          &#151; the bright pair of NGC 6726/27 was discovered in October 1860 
          using only a 6.2-inch refractor at the Athens Observatory. NGC 6726/27 
          both surround bright stars separated by less than 1&#146; and each extend 
          1.5'-2.0' in diameter, merging into a figure 8 shape. NGC 6927&#146;s 
          central star is the variable TY CrA (mag 9-12).</p>
        <p>NGC 6729, which fans out to the southeast of the erratic variable R 
          CrA (T Tauri type with a range from mag 9.7-13.5), is a variable (reflection) 
          nebula similar to the better known Hubble&#146;s Variable Nebula in 
          Monoceros. And further southeast is one of the best dark nebulae in 
          the sky &#151; Bernes 157. Using my 13mm Ethos, there wasn&#146;t a 
          single star visible in the field &#151; an area as the full moon. Scanning 
          even further southeast the sky was eerily vacant.</p>
        <p>A number of highly obscured, young pre-main sequence stars (&lt; 1 
          million years old) and Herbie-Haro (HH) objects have been discovered 
          in this dust cloud in the infrared. A 1984 survey detected a cluster, 
          dubbed &#147;The Coronet&#148;, which is so obscured by dust it is only 
          visible in the infrared. There are roughly 55 known members including 
          several brown dwarf candidates.</p>

        <p align="center">NGC 6928 (brightest in quintet)<br>

          V = 12.2; Size 2.0'x0.6'; Surf Br = 12.3; PA = 106&deg; </p>
        <p align="left">NGC 6928 is the brightest member of a galaxy group in 
          Delphinus at a distance of 150 to 200 million light years - not your 
          usual go to location for galaxies. The brightest three galaxies form 
          a nice trio in a rich star field including a mag 8.6 star 4&#146; SSW. 
          NGC 6928 is visible in a 8&#148; scope &#151; my first observation was 
          through a C-8 on Mt. Hamilton 36 years ago! A 10&#148; scope will add 
          NGC 6930 and a 12&#148; will show NGC 6927. The group was photographed 
          using the Mt. Wilson 60&#148; before 1920 and NGC 6928 was described 
          as a &quot;left-handed spiral, two arms making about three-fourths of 
          a turn each. Brightest in the middle where the two arms join with a 
          slight offset, forming a bent line 35&quot; long.&#148; </p>
        <p>Visually NGC 6928 appeared moderately bright, elongated 4:1 WNW-ESE, 
          ~1.2&#146;x0.3&#146; with a noticeably brighter core. A mag 13.5 star 
          hugs the north edge near the center. Perhaps the most interesting target, 
          though, is NGC 6930. It was moderately faint, very thin edge-on, ~50&#148;x10&#148; 
          with a slightly brighter core. A mag 15.5 star is barely off the south 
          tip. Right at the north tip is LEDA 200365, an extremely faint and tiny 
          galaxy. I previously had detected it (barely) through my 18&#148;. LEDA 
          214749, another dim galaxy, is 1.7&#146; southeast.</p>

          NGC 6962 (brightest in group WBL 666)<br>
          20 47 19.0 +00 19 14; Aquarius<br>
          V = 12.1; Size 2.9'x2.3'; Surf Br = 14.1; PA = 75&deg; </p>
        <p align="left">This is the 5th time I&#146;ve observed the NGC 6962 group 
          (WBL 666) &#151; the first look was in 1984 using a 13.1-inch Coulter 
          Odyssey I. The group also includes NGC 6959, -61, -64, -65 and -67. 
          There&#146;s been a great deal of confusion regarding the identifications, 
          resulting in conflicting names, specifically regarding NGC 6959, -61, 
          -63 and -67. And the galaxy labeled as NGC 6965 is also known as IC 
          5058. William Herschel discovered the two brightest members, NGC 6962 
          and 6964 in 1785. The other four galaxies were discovered through Lord 
          Rosse&#146;s 72-inch in 1857 and 1876. The group lies at a distance 
          of ~180 million light years</p>
        <p>The bright spiral NGC 6962 is interesting -- I initially noticed only 
          the central region at 375x, calling it &quot;moderately large, slightly 
          elongated ~E-W, sharply concentrated with a very bright core, ~40&quot; 
          diameter, with an intense nucleus.&#148; But lowering the power to 200x, 
          I noticed a very large, low surface brightness halo, extending ~2.5&#146; 
          diameter with a mag 14.5 is at the west edge (1.4' from center) and 
          a similar star 1.7' east of center. Two known supernovae have popped 
          off in NGC 6962 &#151; SN 2002ha (type Ia), which reached mag 14.6, 
          and 2003dt (type Ia). The progenitor star in both cases was a white 
          dwarf in a binary system.</p>
        <p>Spindle-shaped NGC 6959 was easily visible extending ~0.7&#146;x0.3&#146; 
          with a slightly brighter core. It has a close companion &#151; LEDA 
          162626 &#151; just 1.1&#146; to its northwest. The companion was a tough 
          low surface brightness patch that only occasionally popped, but its 
          redshift (z = .013) matches the other members of the group.</p>

            Both V = 16.3</p>
          <p align="left">MAC 2-123 and MAC 2-203 are a pair of type A2 Ia and 
            A3 Ia supergiants within M31. At mag 16.3 they are possibly the brightest 
            individual stars in M31 in the V band! Various papers report V magnitudes 
            between 16.2 and 16.5. The two stars are separated by only 52&#148;, 
            so they essentially form a wide pair within an OB association (A48). 
            At 375x, the stars were noticed almost immediately near the edge of 
            visibility using a Megastar chart.</p>
          <p align="left">Once I knew their exact location just north of a line 
            (see photo) connecting two mag 12.3 and 13.1 stars separated by 5.8' 
            NW-SE, I could barely hold the stars continuously using careful averted 
            vision. I believe MAC 2-123 was slightly easier to see. Of course, 
            visually, they&#146;re nothing more than dim specks, but knowing their 
            distance is 2.5 million light years &#151; well, that&#146;s pretty 
            amazing!</p>
          <p align="left">The two stars are included in the 1994 paper &quot;<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994A%26A...287..885H">Spectroscopic

          <p align="left">This boring looking elliptical was targeted due to its 
            confirmed redshift of z = .1375, which implies a light-travel time 
            of 1.75 billion years! At 375x it was just an extremely faint and 
            small smudge that only occasionally popped. The exact position was 
            aided by a mag 15.7 stellar &#147;signpost&#148; only 20&#148; NE 
            (the faint blue star on this SDSS image). It was too faint to really 
            estimate a size, but seemed nearly stellar.</p>
          <p align="left">This galaxy can be found 1&deg; northwest of M2 and 
            7' SW of mag 9.2 HD 204738. Redshift surveys have determined LEDA 
            188874 is the cD (central dominant) galaxy in a distant galaxy cluster, 
            identified as WHL J213027.0-000024. NED lists a total of 43 galaxies 
            within 10&#146; that have similar redshifts, though CGCG 375-048, 
            a much brighter galaxy 8&#146; E, is in the foreground (z = .03).</p>
          <p align="left">Hickson Compact Groups are scattered across the Fall 
            skies and I looked at HCG 86, 87, 88, 89, 93 and 97. Here are three

            NGC 6978 = HCG 88A (brightest member of HCG 88)<br>
            20 52 35.4 -05 42 39; Aquarius<br>
            V = 13.3; Size 1.5'x0.7'; Surf Br = 13.2; PA = 125&deg;</p>
          <p align="left">HCG 88 consists of a nearly linear quartet of spirals 
            in Aquarius, about 4&deg; north of 3.8-magnitude Epsilon Aquarii. 
            The group lies at a distance of 260-270 million light years and includes 
            two additional fainter members (one is a very dim galaxy to the lower 
            right of NGC 6976) that didn&#146;t make Hickson&#146;s magnitude 
            cut-off, so it&#146;s really a sextet. Three are relatively easy NGCs 
            in a straight line &#151; NGC 6978, 6977, 6976 &#151; along with one 
            very tough spiral, HCG 88D, to their southwest.</p>
          <p align="left">Based on this SDSS image the spirals look unperturbed 
            and quite regular in structure. But deeper images shows that HCG 88A 
            (NGC 6978) has a faint plume to the northwest. There is no similar 
            extension on the southeast end of the galaxy, suggesting it&#146;s 
            the remnant of a tidal tail seen in interacting galaxies. Also HCG 
            88B shows a shift in orientation from N-S in the SDSS image to more 
            NW-SE on deeper images, indicating a possible shell-like outer structure 
            to this galaxy - also evidence of a past interaction (2015 paper by 
            Brosch: &quot;Galaxy interactions in the Hickson Compact Group 88&#148;).</p>
          <p align="left">HCG 88A was moderately bright and large, very elongated 
            3:1 NW-SE, ~1.1&#146;x0.35&#146;. It was brighter along the central 
            axis and contained a small bright core. A mag 14.8 star lies 1.3' 
            SSW, halfway to NGC 6977 = HCG 88B. 88B was just slightly fainter 
            (still moderately bright), round, 50&#148; across and also showing 
            a brighter core. The halo had a slightly uneven surface brightness 
            like a face-on spiral often shows. NGC 6976 = HCG 88C was fairly faint, 
            round, just 24&quot; diameter, with a fairly low surface brightness 
            and slightly brighter core. Finally, HCG 88D was easily the faintest 
            of the quartet. I&#146;ve glimpsed it in my old 18&#148;, but it was 
            barely a threshold observation. Even in the 24-inch it was just an 
            extremely faint (V = 14.9, B = 15.8), elongated smudge, visible intermittently.</p>

          <p align="left">Hickson 93 lies within the Great Square of Pegasus on 
            the southwest side, about 4.5&deg; NE of 2.5-magnitude Alpha Pegasi 
            (Markab). Although there are five apparent members, the faintest member 
            HCG 93E lies far in the background based on its 75% higher redshift. 
            The brightest three members &#151; NGC 7547, 7549 and 7550 &#151; 
            are also known as Arp 99. Halton Arp placed the trio in his category 
            of &quot;spiral galaxies with E galaxy companions on arms&#148;. The 
            spiral is obviously NGC 7549 with its long distorted arms, but despite 
            Arp&#146;s classification neither of its neighbors are connected to 
            the arms of NGC 7549. In fact the main visible signs of interaction 
            is directly between NGC 7547 and 7550 are streams of gas and dust 
            pulled out of NGC 7547 and particularly NGC 7550. However, HCG 93B 
            displays bright H-alpha regions on the tips of the bar and on the 
            inner region of the western spiral arm, further evidence of the interaction. 
          </p>
          <p align="left">I caught just a hint of these spiral arms as brighter 
            arcs on the outside of the central region, but nothing of the thin 
            stretched extensions. I&#146;ve looked at HCG 93 a total of 7 times 
            since 1989, mostly through my old 18-inch, and it&#146;s one of the 
            easier (relatively) quintets. Surprisingly, William Herschel only 
            found the single galaxy NGC 7550, which has the highest surface brightness. 
            I logged the central region as &quot;strongly concentrated with a 
            very bright, prominent core that increased to a sharp stellar nucleus.&#148; 
            John Herschel added its companion NGC 7547, but the other three galaxies 
            were discovered through Lord Rosse&#146;s 72-inch in Ireland and William 
            Lassell&#146;s 48-inch equatorial reflector (both speculum mirrors) 
            on the island of Malta.</p>

          <p align="left">Finally, HCG 97 is another compact group &#151; all 
            of the members with IC designations &#151; and a range of V magnitudes 
            from 13.0 to 15.6. The entire quintet was discovered by E.E. Barnard 
            on 28 October 1889, while he was observing Brooks Comet (1889V) through 
            the 36-inch Clark refractor at Lick Observatory. The group includes 
            two ellipticals, two spirals and a faint lenticular (97E). X-ray maps 
            of the region exhibit strikingly elongated contours extending from 
            NW to SE, which is roughly the same orientation the 5 galaxies are 
            scattered. That suggests the group would display significant signs 
            of interactions such as shells, tails, bridges or diffuse light, but 
            there&#146;s no obvious signatures of an ongoing interaction.</p>
          <p align="left">I previously had observed the brightest 4 galaxies through 
            my 18&#148;, but this was my first successful sighting of HCG 97E 
            (V = 15.6, B = 16.6). It was just a very small, round knot, probably 
            10&quot;-12&#148; diameter and required averted vision. Surprisingly 
            HCG 97B is the second most challenging member. This edge-on streak 
            extends ~6:1 NW-SE, ~50&quot;x8&quot;, with a low even surface brightness 
            and no central brightening. A mag 10.4 star sits 1.5&#146; WSW.</p>
          <p align="left">One of the criteria to qualify as a compact group is 
            isolation &#151; the nearest non-member is supposed to be at least 
            at least three times further separated than the radius of the group. 
            In the case of the HCG 97 there are a pair of galaxies &#151; MCG 
            -01-60-040 and -041 that are about 10&#146; SE &#151; just beyond 
            that limit, which are also members of the group (same redshift of 
            z = .021). In addition MCG -01-60-043 is just over 20&#146; to the 
            east of the group. In fact, I ran into MCG -01-60-041 25 years ago 
            with my 18&#148;, while searching for HCG 97. So, the quintet is really 
            the compact core of a larger, scattered group of galaxies. </p>
