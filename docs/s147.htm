<h1>Simeis 147 Observed</h1>

After two months of nasty weather, flu, and moon-lit skies I finally got



a chance to do some first class observing. Perhaps the most remarkable



observation (the last of the night), was touring the vast SNR complex



known as Simeis 147. Truthfully, I was expecting to see only a few hints 



of nebulousity and perhaps a wisp or two. What I did observe was quite extraordinary!<p>







Conditions and instrument used:<br>



Lm (visual) ~ 6.5 near S147; telescopic >17.5<br>



20-inch f/3.9, well baffled and with 1/40 wave optics<br>



40mm eyepiece + O III filter<p>







The first area observed was around star SAO 77322, where a large,



well-defined streak extended 15' to the east. Other knots and streaks



were observed near and south of SAO 77350.<p> 







A broad, very diffuse 



band of nebulousity could be traced from the first



star eastward to a most amazing and intricate region of the entire SNR.



Located in <A HREF="s147pix.htm">region B</A> of <a href="simeis.htm">Jim Shields' finder chart</a>,



it is an interwoven tapestry of filaments and nebulous arcs against a



beautiful starry background. In one sector, several filaments were



visible criss-crossing each other at nearly right angles!<p>







Moving northward, faint nebulous arcs and patches were visible in



<A HREF="s147pix.htm">regions 'D' and 'C'</A>. Around C, some secondary details were visible -



though not nearly as richly complex as in region 'B'. Other wispy patches



were observed surrounding some of the bright stars to the NW of <A HREF="s147pix.htm">region 'A'</A>



(see drawing).<p>







In summary, a very stunning object provided that the skies are sharp and



contrasty and you are using an instrument of similar caliber.<p>


P.S. - the drawing was produced by sketching/noting details on a Guide



6.0 isophoto map of the region.<p><hr><p>







<i>I'll concur with Rich's post here.  The several wisps had a "curdled"



appearance as much of the nebulosity away from the brighter filaments was on the edge of



visibility.  The two arcs, one at SAO 77322, the other about 15' south were



easily visible.  Much like the Veil, the arcs could be followed for approximately



two degrees around the periphery of the object. It's tough to get an observation like this 



right at the beginning of the year. I'll be comparing my later observations with it all year long!</i> - Gil Shillcutt<p>
