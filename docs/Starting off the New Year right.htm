            With the weather forecast looking increasingly poor for the remainder of the January moon window in the San Francisco bay region, I met with Dennis Beckley on January 1st (Tuesday
            night) at Lake Sonoma. The weather models were inconsistent — we were either going to get hosed by clouds streaming down from Washington and Oregon or we could luck out and any
            clouds would pass to our west or east, leaving the Sonoma County region in the clear.
          </div>
          <p align="left">It turned out the weather gods were in a good mood on New Years day! We had almost perfectly clear skies (some clouds were visible near the horizon to the south.
          Furthermore, there was no wind, not a hint of dew and the transparency and seeing were very good. I observed from roughly 6:30 to midnight and logged three dozen objects. C/46P
          Wirtanen, which peaked in brightness last month, was still very bright and barely visible naked-eye.</p>
          <p align="left">Before leaving home I made a list of targets from the UGCA catalogue — this is the Uppsala General Catalogue Addendum. The 1973 UGC only covered galaxies north of
          -02° declination. It was one of the primary galaxy catalogues that were based on the first Palomar Sky Survey. It included 12,921 galaxies at least 1’ in diameter, complete to
          roughly 15th magnitude. An addendum was published the following year adding 400+ galaxies mostly south of the equator. The addendum is a hodgepodge of bright southern NGCs, large
          low surface brightness dwarfs and compact northern galaxies. I decided to focus on thin edge-ons south of the equator. Thin celestial splinters are always an appealing and
          distinctive target! Observations were made through my 24-inch f/3.7 Starstructure.</p>

          star for a companion, though. The galaxy hosted a type Ia supernova in 1998.</p>
          <p align="left">Visually I found this galaxy fairly faint, moderately large, very elongated 6:1 SSW-NNE, 1.2'x0.2'. A mag 12.8 star is just following the NNE end [57" from center].
          A mag 16.1 star is just preceding the SSW side [41" from center]. Located 20' SE of mag 6.8 <x-dso>HD 8627</x-dso>.</p>

          no indication of a central bulge. The galaxy is a member of the Lyon Galaxy Group (LGG) 049, which includes <x-dso>NGC 833</x-dso>, 835, 838 and 839 — also known as Hickson Compact Group (HCG)

          small bright (round) core. A very faint, larger halo changed the ratio to 3:2, ~45"x30". A mag 15.1 star was barely off the north side. Located 52' W of <x-dso>NGC 1041</x-dso> and 17' SSW of mag
          8.5 <x-dso>HD 16378</x-dso>. This galaxy has hosted two supernovae this century — type-II 2004er and type-Ib 2009ha and its redshift-independent distance is roughly 160 million l.y.</p>
