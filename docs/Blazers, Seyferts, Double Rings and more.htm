        <p align="center">On two consecutive Wednesdays (21st and 28th of December) 
          I observed under clear skies at Lake Sonoma, located 30 miles north 
          of Santa Rosa just above numerous Sonoma county vineyards. On both evenings 
          we had small groups at the Lone Rock lot, in the hills above the lake 
          (the photo was taken as I arrived on the 21st). The first Wednesday 
          I was joined by Bob Douglas with his 28-inch f/3.7 Starstructure and 
          Carter Scholz with a homemade 16-inch with Zambuto optics. Conditions 
          were excellent - perfectly clear, fairly good transparency for this 
          site (SQM readings hit 21.4 by 11:00 PM), perfectly calm with no dew. 
          I returned on the 28th with Bob and we were joined by Mark Toney (20&#148; 
          Teeter Dob) along with a friend. Again we had perfectly clear skies 
          with SQM readings in the 21.3-21.4 range and good seeing. Both nights 
          we started observing around 6:30 and closed shop by 12:30 and over those 
          12 hours were very productive &#150; I logged a total of 90 different 
          objects in my 24-inch f/3.7 Starstructure. My observing list in included 
          a mix of interacting and other unusual galaxies as well as a few galaxy 
          groups and I&#146;ve highlighted several of these below.</p>
        <p>I started off both evenings by taking a look at the amazing blazar 
          CTA 102, which at a redshift z = 1.037 has a light travel time of 8 
          billion years! Normally this quasar shines dimly at 17-17.5 magnitude, 
          but is known to be an OVV &#151; an Optically Violent Variable quasar. 
          In the past couple of months it experienced a historic outburst reading 
          reaching mag 12.7-12.8 when I took a look in November. It&#146;s been 
          fluctuating wildly in the past few weeks &#151; on the 21st I logged 
          it at mag 12.7 and was impressed that it was easily seen when I added 
          an 8-inch aperture stop to my scope. But on the 28th it appeared at 
          least a half-magnitude brighter than a nearby mag 11.7 star, so was 
          certainly mag 11.1-11.3 and has now been glimpsed in down to a 50mm 
          refractor. Wow!! When I later checked on the AAVSO web site, I found 
          that several observers measured magnitudes in the 11.2 range, so my 
          estimate was accurate. This latest incredible outburst is over 300 times 
          brighter than its &#147;rest&#148; magnitude. I just noticed the Fermi 
          Gamma-ray Space Telescope also recorded an outburst of 135 times its 
          average gamma-ray flux on the 28th, making CTA 102 the brightest gamma-ray 
          source in the sky.</p>

          V = 11.9; Size 3.0'x2.5'; Surf Br = 14.0; PA = 175&deg; (data for NGC 
          309)</p>
        <p>This beautiful grand-design galaxy is one of the largest (diameter 
          ~225,000 light years) and most luminous known spirals (absolute blue 
          magnitude = -22.52). Even at a distance of 260-270 million light years 
          it has a V mag of 11.9! In fact Arp used this galaxy as an example of 
          a discordant redshift &#151; he felt it was just too large for its redshift 
          and mentioned that M81 could comfortably fit in between its gargantuan 
          spiral arms. It also appears to be something of supernova factory, hosting 
          4 in the past 17 years: SN 2014ef, 2012dt, 2008cx and 1999ge.</p>
        <p>In my 24&#148; it was fairly faint but moderately large, roundish, 
          fairly low but uneven surface brightness, contains a brighter core that 
          increases somewhat to the center. I noted hints of spiral arms in the 
          halo (slightly brighter arcs) &#151; this was before viewing an image. 
          A mag 12.5 star is 2&#146; NNE and mag 15 star is off the west side, 
          1.5' from center.</p>
        <p>Nearby is IC 1602, which lies 13&#146; WSW. This galaxy is the brightest 
          member of Abell Galaxy Cluster (AGC) 117 with a redshift-based (z = 
          .055) distance of ~738 million light years. I noted IC 1602 as fairly 
          faint, round, 20&quot; diameter, slightly brighter nucleus. AGC 117 
          is one of the galaxy clusters in the Pisces-Cetus Supercluster, one 
          of the largest known structures in the universe (see <a href="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/superc/psccet.html">http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/superc/psccet.html</a>).</p>

          <p align="left">Arp 54 is a little-known interacting pair at a distance 
            of ~570 million light-years. It shows up in infrared surveys, as a 
            radio source as well as an x-ray source, so it apparently is experiencing 
            very vigorous star formation or perhaps has an obscured active galactic 
            nucleus (AGN) &#151; both signs of an interaction. Arp placed it in 
            his classification of &quot;Spiral galaxies with high surface brightness 
            companion on arm&#148;, though it doesn&#146;t appear that the arm 
            from the larger galaxy reaches the smaller galaxy. The edge-on to 
            the south is not related to Arp 54.</p>
          <p align="left">Using 375x the larger galaxy (PGC 9113) appeared fairly 
            faint, elongated 3:2 E-W, 30&quot;x20&quot;, fairly low surface brightness, 
            weak concentration. Its interacting companion PGC 9107 is just 0.9' 
            WSW. It was a very small faint glow, only 12&quot; diameter. Although 
            it easily popped into view with averted I couldn't hold continuously. 
            A mag 14.4 star is 0.5&#146; SW.</p>

            = 13.2 / 13.2; PA = 47&deg; / 20&deg;</p>
          <p align="left">Arp 112 is an interacting triple system consisting of 
            NGC 7805/7806, along with KUG 2359+311, a strange arc-like galaxy. 
            NGC 7806, the galaxy in the middle of the image, is also a gravitationally 
            disturbed system with a thin tidal tail to the north. It&#146;s not 
            known whether KUG 2359+311 (Kiso Ultraviolet Galaxy) is a pre-existing 
            third galaxy or the remains of one of the other galaxies &#151; it 
            looks like a detached spiral arm to me.</p>
          <p align="left">Through my 24&#148;, NGC 7805 appeared moderately bright 
            (V = 13.3), fairly small, compact, very slightly elongated SW-NE, 
            25&quot;x20&quot;, small bright core and even brighter stellar nucleus. 
            Forms a similar pair with NGC 7806 just 50&quot; NE. A mag 13.5 star 
            is 1' west. Other than a different orientation, NGC 7806 (V = 13.3) 
            is a visual twin of 7805. KUG 2359+311 was only marginally glimpsed 
            in the 24-inch (V = 16.3), so I asked Bob Douglas if we could look 
            at Arp 112 in his 28-inch. By bumping the power to 427x we were able 
            to glimpse a small narrow glow in his scope.</p>

            V = 13.9; Size = 1.0&#146;x0.5&#146;; PA = 0&deg;</p>
          <p align="left">Visually, there&#146;s nothing remarkable about this 
            galaxy, which appears to be a coelesced merger of two galaxies. Using 
            432x I logged it as &quot;fairly faint, slightly elongated N-S, 25&quot;x20&quot;. 
            Two 13th magnitude stars are 50&quot; NW and 1.0' W and a mag 14.5 
            star is 1.0' ESE.&quot;</p>
          <p align="left">But astrophysically Mrk 1018 is quite unusual. It&#146;s 
            a Seyfert galaxy, a type of spiral with an active galactic nucleus 
            powered by a massive black hole and whose spectrum contains emission 
            lines from highly ionized gas. Type 1 Seyferts contain extremely broad 
            optical emission lines indicating the nucleus contains hot gas near 
            the accretion disc that&#146;s moving/expanding at very high speeds. 
            Type 2 Seyferts display only narrow emission lines, while Seyfert 
            1.5, 1.8 and 1.9 are intermediate cases. The two main classes are 
            thought to reflect different activity levels of black hole feeding, 
            though possibly the viewing angle of the accretion disc is a factor.</p>
          <p align="left">Historically, Mrk 1018 has been classified as a type 
            1.9 Seyfert. But in the 1980s, prominent broad lines appeared in the 
            optical spectrum and it changed its classification to a Type 1 AGN. 
            In 2006, though, it was announced that in the past five years Mrk 
            1018 has returned to its original state type 1.9 state (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04423v1.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04423v1.pdf</a>). 
            This second transition is thought to be due to a decrease in the black-hole 
            accretion rate.</p>

          <p align="left">Halton Arp placed NGC 1134 in his category of &#147;Galaxies 
            with material ejected from nuclei&#148;. Probably he is referring 
            to the &#147;tidal plume&#148; off the upper right end of the galaxy 
            generally extending in the direction of UGC 2362, the chaotic blue 
            galaxy to the west. These two galaxies have identical redshifts so 
            likely experienced a &#147;close encounter&#148; in the past with 
            the arm of NGC 1134 pulled out by gravitational tides.</p>
          <p align="left">At 375x NGC 1134 appeared fairly bright, elongated 2:1 
            or 5:2 NW-SE, ~1.2'x0.6', sharply concentrated with a bright core 
            and fairly bright, sharp stellar nucleus. It was slightly brighter 
            along the east edge with averted vision &#151; probably the bright 
            section of the eastern spiral arm on Rick Johnson&#146;s image. A 
            mag 13.6 star is 50&quot; NE of center. UGC 2362, 7&#146; to the west, 
            appeared faint, very low surface brightness patch ~20&quot; diameter 
            (probably the brighter central part of this Magellanic system). A 
            mag 14.8 star is 0.8' S.</p>

          <p align="left">At 375x I called this galaxy &quot;fairly faint, moderately 
            large, elongated 5:2 WSW-ENE, ~1.2'x.0.5', large brighter core, no 
            sharp nucleus. The halo brightens slightly at the WSW edge - perhaps 
            a knot in the galaxy?&quot;</p>
          <p align="left">I was pleased when I checked later and found the PanSTARRS-1 
            image above clearly shows a small galaxy (identified as 2MASX J01595678-1104533 
            in NED), at the position I noted. Although this galaxy appears to 
            be superimposed, I don&#146;t know whether the companion is actually 
            at the same distance (no published redshift) or possibly in front 
            of IC 1767.</p>

          <p align="left">This group (called WBL 061) resides in Pisces at a distance 
            of ~250 million light years and is dominated by the NGC 741/742 double 
            system. NGC 741 has an unusually large halo, sometimes indicative 
            of galactic cannibilism and if you look carefully there&#146;s a small 
            stellar like object immediately to the left of the nucleus of NGC 
            741. Perhaps a former companion that strayed too close and is now 
            falling into the nucleus of NGC 741? NGC 741 has a extended X-ray 
            halo reaching a distance of 19&#146; from its center. Furthermore, 
            twin radio jets emerge from the nucleus of NGC 742 and spread into 
            a larger lobe that encircles NGC 741.</p>
          <p align="left">Visually, NGC 741 appeared bright, moderately large, 
            round, sharply concentrated with a small very bright core that increases 
            to the center. The halo increases with averted to over 1&#146; diameter. 
            A mag 11 star is 2.4' NW. NGC 742 is just 0.8' E of center at the 
            edge of the halo at a projected separation of ~55,000 light years. 
            This is a small galaxy but has a high surface brightness. It was moderately 
            bright, round, 15&#148; diameter. The following half-dozen galaxies

            ESO 474-026 is a unique double-ringed galaxy with two perpendicular 
            rings -- both an equatorial ring and a polar ring surrounding a central 
            nearly spherical galaxy (the only component that was visible). It 
            is thought to be have resulted from the major merger of two similar 
            mass haloes. There is no nearby &#147;hit and run&#148; collider galaxy 
            in the vicinity. ESO 474-026 is on a list of the most luminous galaxies 
            (Cappi et al. 1998) and a strong source of far-infrared and CO emission. 
            Its nuclear spectrum indicates active star formation.</p>
          <p align="left">Visually it appeared fairly faint, irregularly round, 
            25&quot; diameter, very small bright nucleus with a stellar peak. 
            The Redshift-based (z = .0527) distance is roughly 700 million years 
            so I wasn&#146;t expecting to see anything of the ring structures. 
            But it was fun to contemplate this blazing beacon that shines at a 
            relatively bright mag 13.7 over this vast distance.</p>
