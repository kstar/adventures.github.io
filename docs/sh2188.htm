This huge filamentary complex was discovered at the Simiez
observatory in Russia in 1951 and was relisted in a survey by Sharpless in
1959. Jay McNeil provided me with background information on this interesting
object. Both Simiez and Sharpless classified this object as an emission
object and at one point it was considered both an HII region and a SNR based
on its wispy appearance (like a dim version of Pickering's Wedge in the
Veil). It wasn't until the 90's that Simeiz 22 first appeared in PNe lists
and it is now considered an ancient, crescent-shaped planetary similar to the
Medusa Nebula (Abell 21). The best view of this phantom object was at 100x
(20 Nagler) using an OIII filter. With averted vision, a large, low surface
brightness glow was visible, elongated ~E-W and perhaps 8' in length with a
better defined southern edge. Several mag 13-14 stars are superimposed. It
wasn't easy to identify this planetary (definitely not your garden-variety
type). - Steve Gottlieb<p>
