        <p align="left">Several observers met at the new home of our friend Kevin 
          Ritschell on June 13, for a night of observing. Present were Jamie Dillon, 
          Peter Natscher, David Cooper, Richard Navarrete and myself. This new 
          site is close to Lake San Antonio, where southern and northern California 
          amateur astronomers have been meeting annually for CalStar, each September 
          or October new moon. Kevin's place is higher elevation, and darker than 
          CalStar.</p>
        <p align="left">The drive there along the backroads was easy and enjoyable. 
          Below is a shot from of one of the area's less traveled byways, with 
          a view of Pinnacles National Monument in the distance. Its really quite 
          easy to get to these places.</p>

        </p>
        <p align="left">These dark skies are within two and one half hours south 
          of the San Francisco bay area, and provide very good observing for an 
          overnight trip. The travel there and back is part of the enjoyment, 
          as a respite from the crowded cities and bright night skies. </p>
        <p align="left">This was an easy paced night observing targets we'd visited 
          years ago in smaller telescopes, and spending plenty of time just enjoying 
          the ambience our host provided and seeing friends again. We certainly 
          weren't pushing it.</p>
        <p align="left">Here are my notes on a few targets Richard and I observed 
          together in our 18&quot; f/4.5 Obsession Dobsonians. It is always interesting 
          to see afterward how closely my visual notes match images of the objects.<br>

        </div>
        <p align="left">Viewed in 12mm Nagler - NGC 5619 is easy to see but still 
          somewhat dim. 2x1 ratio, about 2.1'x1.1' in size, ne/sw. IC 4244 is 
          also elongated in a nearly perpendicular position angle, smaller and 
          with a brightened core. The UGC 9258 is the dimmest and equidistant 
          away from the IC as the IC is away from the NGC. UGC is smallest and 
          round</p>

        <p align="center">NGC 6369: Planetary Nebula &quot;Litle Ghost&quot; in 
          Ophiuchus. Magnitude 13.0, size 1.1'. Distance unknown.</p>
        <p align="left">Viewed with 7mm Nagler, no filter. Very bright due to 
          its small size, and quite round. Contains a very large and dark annularity 
          for its size. The ring shape is fairly even brightness with one edge 
          slightly darker. Just a small out of focus star in the 20mm Nagler.</p>

        <p align="center">IC 4593: Planetary Nebula in Hercules. Magnitude 10.0, 
          size 0.3. Distance unknown.</p>
        <p align="left">With a 7mm Nagler and NPB narrowband filter. This very 
          small planetary, appering nearly stellar, is given away by its color. 
          It contains a bright central star, with an oval disk that is tight to 
          the star and requires magnification to see easily. Possible dim outer 
          envelope but nothing I can claim as certain, just suspected.</p>

        <p align="center">NGC 6217: Barred spiral galaxy in Ursa Minor. Magnitude 
          11.20, size 3.4'. 67 million light years distant</p>
        <p align="left">Observed with a 12mm Nagler - described in the Night Sky 
          Observer's Guide as round, but it seems elongated. Or there could be 
          a bright elongated central section crossing a round dimmer galaxy Largish, 
          and obvious, bright core. A 7mm Nagler shows galaxy to look inclined 
          oval with hints of spiral arms. Core is intense and non-stellar at this 
          magnification - slight possibility of an elongation or short bar extending 
          from the core. With a 5mm a knot appears away from the core maybe 2/3rd 
          the distance to the edge of the disk.</p>

        <p align="center"><img src="images/n4490.jpg" width="400" height="400" border="1"></p>
        <p align="center">N4490: Spiral galaxy with attached companion in Canes 
          Venatici. Magnitude 9.8, size 6.7'x2.1'. Nicknamed The Cocoon Galaxy. 
          Distance unknown.</p>
        <p>With a 12mm Nagler there are two bright galaxies in close proximity, 
          at nearly right angles to each other. The larger galaxy is very bright, 
          elongated with a bright and thick chaotic chore. Clearly a spiral galaxy, 
          it has a section away form and arcing toward the dimmer of the pair. 
          This section is longer and larger than that rather stunted but thick 
          section opposite the larger galaxy's core. The smaller galaxy, NGC 4485 
          is angled toward NGC 4490, but close to right angle. It too appears 
          distorted and uneven, shorter and bright. N4490 is about 2x1 in ratio, 
          N4485 is about a third the size and a comma shape, with the concave 
          section toward the length of N4490.<br>

        <p align="center"><img src="images/n5996.jpg" width="400" height="400" border="1"></p>
        <p align="center">N5996: Elongated galaxy with a close companion in Bootes. 
          Magnitude 14.4, size 1.5'x0.8'. Distance unknown.</p>
        <p align="left">Using a 7mm Nagler, the main galaxy is oddly shaped, elongated 
          but appears as if it is asymmetrical. Very obvious apparently double 
          stellar cores, the galaxy is at close to a right angle from a pair of 
          very close by equal magnitude stars. Opposite the galaxy from the pair 
          of stars is a single dimmer star, and NGC 5994, a much dimmer galaxy 
          is just off it opposite side from the double stars.</p>
