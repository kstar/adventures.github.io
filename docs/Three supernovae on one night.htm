          <p>Friday night (January 31, 2014) was clear but cold (in the mid 30’s) and breezy at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Sonoma">Lake Sonoma</a>. As opposed to last weekend,
          I was glad I packed my winter clothing gear. Nevertheless, conditions were good for deep sky viewing with SQM reading starting off at 21.2 and topping 21.4 after midnight. And
          seeing was surprisingly steady (easily holding 375x on galaxies). The night started with a beautiful scene after sunset -- a thin 28-hour crescent moon was hung low in the west with
          Mercury, at its greatest elongatation, shining brightly 6° to its upper left (east).</p>
          <p>I spend most of the night working on a mixed-bag of reflection and emission nebulae, disrupted and interacting galaxies, and small groups the highlight was a 15 minute tour of
          three supernovae in bright galaxies! The blazing mag 10.5 orange-red SN 2014J in <x-dso>M82</x-dso> was of course the showpiece, info <a href=
          "http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/home/Bright-Supernova-in-M82-241477661.html">here</a>, but there's also a relatively easy one in <x-dso>NGC 3448</x-dso> in Ursa Major (SN 2014G) that was
          discovered on January 14th. This one is located at the southwest tip (44” west and 20” south of center) and was quite easy in my 24-inch. It was immediately noticed at 125x, but
          200x provided a better view. It was listed at mag 14.0, but I thought it might be a bit brighter. Here’s an <a href="http://www.k-itagaki.jp/assets/3448.jpg">image</a>.</p>
          <p>The challenging object was a faint supernova in <x-dso>M99</x-dso> (SN 2014L), which was just discovered on January 26th . Nothing was seen at 200x, but bumping up the magnification to 375x, a
          very faint "star" was visible just southwest of the core. I most likely would not have noticed it without knowing the location beforehand. I would guess a magnitude in the 15.5
          range is reasonable and coupled with the location, that makes for a pretty tough target. I don't know if this is one the rise or fall or just buried behind dust. In any case, fairly
          high magnification is necessary because of the location so close to the core. Here is a <a href=

          <p>Continuing on with more exotic objects, here are the other highlights from the evening ...</p>

          brightness than <x-dso>VV 122b</x-dso>, a highly disrupted Magellanic Irregular just 24" NE. VV 122b appeared faint, small, slightly elongated N-S, ~15"x12" diameter. Increases in size with
          averted to 0.4'x0.3'. This pair is in Arp's category of elliptical galaxies "close to and perturbing spirals"</p>

          very close pair with UGC 3906 NED1 just off the SW side, 30" between centers. The fainter western component appeared as an extremely or very faint, small, irregular hazy glow, ~0.3'
          diameter. Often, the pair merged into a single, very irregular patch but sometimes the two galaxies sharpened up and were clearly resolved individually. Located 11' NE of mag 8.0 HD

          <p>At 200x, a faint but easily seen reflection nebula fanned out in a wide angle to the south of XY Persei (close double with components 9.7/10.6 at 1.2"). The size was difficult to
          estimate, but roughly 3'-3.5' in diameter. The brighter component of XY Per is a young Herbig Ae/Be star.</p>

          <p>This "new" planetary nebula was picked up unfiltered as 200x, though it required known the exact location. Adding a DGM Optics NPB filter, this likely PN was just visible
          continuously with averted vision and appeared very faint, roundish, 30" diameter, low fairly even surface brightness. A mag 15 star is at the NE edge. Located 10.7' SSW of mag 7.3
          <x-dso>HD 44251</x-dso>. Three mag 10 stars lie 4.6' W, 7' SW and 8' WNW.</p>
          <p>HoCr1 was found on images taken by Michael Howell and Richard Crisp in early 2006 assumed to be a possible planetary. My first observation was on Nov 18, 2006 at Bob Ayer's
          property at Willow Springs. While observing with Ray Cash and Mark Wagner, Ray took a stab at this object with his 13.1-inch using a UHC filter and it was marginal at best in
          partially cloudy conditions. I later took a look in my scope when the sky was clear and it was definitely visible, though still only glimpsed part of the time with averted vision at
          115x using a DGM Optics NPB filter. It appeared as an extremely low surface brightness hazy spot, perhaps 30" in diameter. Mark felt the object had an irregularly round shape with
          an occasional sharp edge on its SW perimeter. A trio of faint stars 1' W pinpointed the position. Located 11' SSW of 7.4 magnitude HD 44251 and 37' ENE of the reflection nebula IC
          444.</p>

          in this physical group (distance ~200 million l.y.). It appeared fairly faint to moderately bright, very elongated 3:1 ~N-S, 0.9'x0.3'. <x-dso>ESO 485-004</x-dso>, is a superthin galaxy just 1.2'
          E and easily the faintest member of KTS 26. At 260x and 375x it was glimpsed a few times as a ghostly streak, but this was a threshold object. A very faint star (mag ~15.5) is just
          east of the north end. Finally ESO 485-006 was faint to fairly faint, slightly elongated, ~40"x35", low even surface brightness. Located 10' N of mag 5.6 Upsilon1 (50) Eridani.</p>

          <p>Picked up unfiltered at 200x, though low contrast as the entire field is patchy in faint stars and affected by some dust. Seems roughly 20'x10, elongated N-S and includes several
          bright stars (<x-dso simbad="Collinder 95">Cr 95</x-dso>) with mag 7.9 <x-dso>HD 46005</x-dso> near the center (illuminating star), mag 8.9 <x-dso>HD 258853</x-dso> near the south end, and a mag 9.3 star at or beyond the NW end. The contrast is
          significantly improved at 125x using a NPB filter and the outline is better defined, particularly at the southern end. Although the nebulosity is slightly brighter to the south of
          HD 46005, there are no high surface brightness sections.</p>
