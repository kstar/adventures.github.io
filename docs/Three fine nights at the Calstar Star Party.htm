        <p align="left">In late September I attended the 17th annual CalStar star 
          party in the central California coastal foothills. With roughly 100 
          participants from both northern and southern California, this star party 
          has a more intimate feel than the Golden State Star Party &#150; basically 
          a large tribal get together of astro-nuts. In past years, we&#146;ve 
          had to suffer through some miserably hot days, but this year the temperature 
          was quite pleasant during the daytime and clear star-filled nights.</p>
        <p>This is a three-night star party, so poor weather on one or two nights 
          can really impact the viewing hours, but we were fortunate to have three 
          all-nighters in pretty good conditions. I found the seeing soft early 
          on &#151; though partly this was due to my 24-inch mirror cooling off 
          &#150; but it generally became fairly good by midnight and in fact I 
          resolved an 0.5&#148; double (72 Pegasi) on the first night at 750x! 
          As far as transparency, the skies were a bit disappointing to me early 
          on (21.3 SQM readings), but hit 21.5-21.6 after 1:00 AM. That, in combination 
          with the seeing, allowed me to push my 24-inch f/3.7 pretty deep. A 
          final tally showed I logged notes on 106 objects over the three nights.</p>
        <p>I started off each evening observing a few clusters, globulars and 
          planetaries within the summer Milky Way but we&#146;ve no transitioned 
          to the Fall skies so I quickly moved into the galaxy rich fields of 
          Sculptor, Pegasus, Pisces and Cetus. Here&#146;s a sample of the more 
          interesting targets.</p>

        <p align="left">Arp 121 is an interesting pair of interacting galaxies 
          in Cetus. The eastern galaxy, MCG -01-03-052, appears as a relatively 
          normal-looking elliptical. But the western component, MCG -01-03-051, 
          is highly warped with a tortured appearance. A faint haze of gas and 
          stars appear to connect the pair. Here is Arp&#146;s published image 
          with the Palomar 200&#148;. He considered (based on appearance) that 
          MCG -01-03-051 was tidally disrupted by its elliptical companion.</p>
        <p>Visually Arp 121 is an attractive, close pair. MCG -01-03-051 was moderately 
          bright and large at 322x, very elongated 3:1 N-S, 1.0'x0.3'. MCG -01-03-052, 
          the fainter companion, is just 50&#148; NE. It appeared fairly faint, 
          round, 18&quot; diameter, slightly brighter nucleus. A mag 13.8 star 
          is at the NNE edge [20&quot; from center].</p>

        <p align="left">This pair of IC galaxies lies in the rich cluster Abell 
          195 at a distance of roughly 585 million light years. But what really 
          makes them a challenge is their location &#151; in the glare of two 
          5th magnitude stars!! Surprisingly, the two galaxies were accidentally 
          discovered visually by Sherburne Wesley Burnham, observing with the 
          36-inch refractor at Lick Observatory in July of 1890. He wasn&#146;t 
          searching for galaxies (&#147;nebulae&#148; in those days), but rather 
          examining the two bright stars to see if they were possibly doubles! 
          Turned out they weren&#146;t but he did report the discovery of the 
          two objects in the same field.</p>
        <p align="left">IC 115, just 3.4' SE of mag 5.5 94 Pisces, was the easier 
          of the pair in my 24-inch and readily seen at 375x as fairly faint, 
          slightly elongated, 20&quot; diameter, fairly even surface brightness. 
          IC 113, situated 2.7&#146; NE of mag 5.4 Rho Pisces, was faint, round, 
          15&quot; diameter, low surface brightness. The stars, of course, created 
          a major distraction, so the best views were to move them just outside 
          the field of my view (my scope was tracking) and view each galaxy individually! 
          I also picked up PGC 5359 6' NNW of of 94 Pisces. Although further away 
          from the glare, it was the dimmest of the trio (B = 16.3).</p>

        <p align="left">This is pretty unimpressive galaxy visually. At 375x it 
          appeared as fairly faint, round, compact 15&quot;-18&quot; glow of high 
          surface brightness with a very small brighter nucleus. A companion (CGCG 
          475-031) was picked up 6&#146; SE. But Markarian 315 has a monster at 
          its center. </p>
        <p>Since the early 1970&#146;s, it's been known to house an active galactic 
          nucleus (Seyfert 1.5 nucleus). A highly ionized, collimated jet of gas 
          extends from the nucleus at high speed in O III and H-alpha. This gas 
          is connected to a giant filament. The nature of this filament was uncertain 
          but a 1993 study with the HST revealed a double nucleus. A press release 
          stated, &quot;The Hubble images provide support for the theory that 
          the jet-like feature may be a 'tail' of gas that was stretched out by 
          tidal forces between the two galaxies as they interacted&quot;. An image 
          of the core of Markarian 315, taken with the Hubble Space Telescope's 
          Wide Field and Planetary Camera (in planetary camera mode), shows a 
          second, fainter nucleus located approximately 6,000 light-years (or 
          two arc seconds in angular separation) from the galaxy's bright central 
          nucleus.</p>
        <p>The brighter of the two nuclei is the energetic core of Markarian 315 
          and probably contains a massive blackhole. The fainter nucleus is considered 
          to be the surviving core of a galaxy that recently merged into Markarian 
          315. This observation best explains the extraordinary 240,000-light-year 
          long jet-like feature of Markarian 315. The jet feature is most likely 
          a remnant of a merger between Markarian 315 and a smaller galaxy&#148;.</p>

          NGC 7556 is part of a sprawling group of galaxies in Pisces, including 
          NGC 7532, 7534, 7544, 7546, 7554 and 7566. But it is also closely surrounded 
          by a swarm of faint galaxies shown in this SDSS image. Using 375x and 
          500x, NGC 7556 appeared fairly bright, moderately large, elongated 4:3 
          or 3:2 WNW-ESE, ~0.8'x0.5', well concentrated with a bright core, high 
          surface brightness. A mag 10.6 star lies 2.7' E.</p>
        <p>The closest companion is NGC 7556A at the southwest edge of the halo 
          &#151; just 19&#148; southwest of center! At 500x NGC 7556A appeared 
          extremely faint and small, round, ~8&quot; diameter. Next in order of 
          separation is NGC 7554, just 48&#148; west of center. I found this galaxy 
          fairly faint, small, round, 15&quot; diameter. LEDA 195267 (V magnitude 
          ~14.7), 1.4&#146; to the southeast, appeared fairly faint, small, round, 
          15&#148; diameter. LEDA 195265 (V magnitude ~15.3), 3.3&#146; SSE, was 
          a difficult object only 6&quot; diameter. </p>
        <p>William Herschel discovered NGC 7556 on 20 Sep 1784 with his 18.7-inch 
          speculum reflector and missed the fainter companions. Albert Marth, 
          using a 48-inch fork-mounted speculum reflector, picked up NGC 7554 
          in August of 1864 from the mediterranean island of Malta. LEDA 195267 
          was likely observed in 1850 using Lord Rosse&#146;s 72-inch Leviathan, 
          but he was not positive of the observation and without a confirmation 
          this small galaxy missed out in receiving a NGC designation.</p>

        <p align="left">This photogenic interacting pair is located in Andromeda 
          just 3.8' southwest of a mag 6.2 star (upper left edge of this SDSS 
          image). It appears we&#146;re peering just below the plane of a distorted 
          edge-on spiral (resembling a UFO?) &#150; particularly the tidally disturbed 
          arms or rings stretching to the left (east) and a nucleus that is offset 
          towards the west side. The companion IC 1559 (also known as NGC 169A) 
          is also tidally disrupted, with a plume extending to the southeast and 
          the major axis is nearly perpendicular to NGC 169.</p>
        <p>NGC 169 is fairly bright, elongated 5:2 E-W, ~0.8'x0.3&#146;. It contains 
          a small, bright elongated core that increases to a stellar nucleus. 
          IC 1559 sits at the south egg, just 22&quot; between centers. The companion 
          appeared fairly faint, small, slightly elongated ~N-S, 15&quot; diameter, 
          faint stellar nucleus.</p>

          to the northeast and knots of blue star-forming regions line the northern 
          side of the galaxy.</p>
        <p>NGC 7587 appeared fairly bright, very elongated 3:1 NW-SE, ~50&quot;x18&quot;, 
          high surface brightness, with a small bright core. A mag 11 star lies 
          2.5' NE. NGC 7587B (also known as CGCG 406-051) is 51&#148; to the south. 
          The companion was very faint, small, elongated 2:1 SW-NE, 20&quot;x10&#148;. 
          This region of Pegasus is filled with galaxies. Hickson 95 (brightest

        <p align="left">Unfortunately, this unusual-looking planetary (the image 
          above was taken by the VLT) in Aquila was only seen as a faint &quot;soft&quot; 
          glow, roughly 6&quot; diameter. It dimmed with an OIII filter, though 
          was visible with an NPB filter, but the contrast was improved. The best 
          view was at 375x unfiiltered; it was very easily seen as a round, sharp 
          disc. The central star often sharpened to a point.</p>
        <p>So what makes He 2-428 special? Often remarkable bipolar shapes seen 
          in planetaries are thought to result from the interaction of a binary 
          central star. In March 2015 it was <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v519/n7541/abs/nature14124.html">announced</a> 
          that He 2-428 has a pair of white dwarf central stars! The combined 
          mass is above the Chandrasekhar limit (limit of a stable white dwarf) 
          and the pair is predicted is merge into a single star is roughly 700 
          million years and explode as a Type 1a supernova. This is the first 
          candidate for such a binary double white dwarf star merger/Type Ia supernova 
          known!</p>
        <p>I first observed this planetary back in 1994 and noted the weak OIII 
          filter response (I&#146;m not aware of any earlier amateur observations), 
          but this headline caught my attention last year: &quot;<a href="http://www.sci-news.com/astronomy/science-pair-white-dwarfs-center-planetary-nebula-henize2428-02478.html">Astronomers

          UGC 12578 (sometimes identified as NGC 7667) is a highly irregularly 
          Magellanic-type galaxy with numerous blue knots of massive newly-minted 
          stars. A spray of gas and stars extends off the east end of the galaxy. 
          UGC 12589 is perhaps stranger and certainly appears to be a colliding 
          pair of galaxies in the process of merging. This is actually a composite 
          of two SDSS fields, so the galaxies appear much closer in the image 
          than in the sky. You might assume the two UGCs were interacting (or 
          had interacted in the past) with each other but based on their redshifts, 
          UGC 12589 lies far in the background at 3 to 4 times the distance of 
          UGC 12578.</p>
        <p>At 375x, UGC 12578 appeared faint, fairly small, elongated 3:2 ~E-W, 
          ~30&quot;x20&quot;, low even surface brightness (surprisingly faint). 
          UGC 12589, 12&#146; to the northeast, was also very faint, very elongated

          It&#146;s been classified as a luminous infrared Seyfert 2 galaxy experiencing 
          both starburst and AGN activity. It appears surrounded by a ring of 
          stars and gas with a condensation (captured dwarf companion?) on the 
          east end. NGC 7682 is an apparently undisturbed SB(r)ab spiral, but

        <p>I found NGC 7679 fairly bright, round, 25&quot;-30&quot; diameter, 
          high surface brightness. It contains a small intense core that increases 
          to a faint stellar nucleus. Burnham 1222, a close 1.4&quot; pair of 
          mag 10 stars, lies 5' NW and this pair was cleanly resolved at 375x.

        <p align="left">The KTS catalogue is a southern extension of the KTG Isolated 
          Triplets of Galaxies by husband and wife astronomers Valentina Karachentseva 
          and Igor Karachentsev. The 1979 KTG contains 84 northern hemisphere 
          trios found by visual inspection of the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey 
          plates. They considered a group &#147;isolated&quot; if the nearest 
          &#147;significant&#148; neighbor was at least three times as far away 
          as the separations of the components. In 1998 there was a follow-up 
          study using the Russian 6-meter Large Altazimuth Telescope that found 
          magnitudes, diameters, separations, morphological types, configurations, 
          and radial velocities. Roughly 25% of the K-triplets are chance alignments 
          and not true physical systems. In 2000, their study was extended and 
          76 southern triplets (KTS 1 through 76) were added.</p>
        <p>KTS 3 is found in Sculptor and it also caught the attention of Halton 
          Arp and Barry Madore, who catalogued it as a triple system in their 
          Arp-Madore &#147;Catalogue of Southern Peculiar Galaxies and Associations&#148;.

          that increases to the center. The halo increased in size with averted 
          vision. It forms a pair with ESO 410-25 = KTS 3B just 2.2' E. This one 
          was faint, small, elongated 5:3 SW-NE, 20&quot;x12&quot;, low even surface 
          brightness. I missed KTS 3C - it&#146;s a difficult edge-on and the 
          southerly declination makes it an even tougher catch. I plan to give 
          it another try.</p>

        <p align="left">OK, this single galaxy in a barren field doesn&#146;t 
          look very exciting. But look at the big picture. Galaxies are generally 
          arranged in cosmic hierarchy, starting in groups, clusters and rich 
          superclusters stretching millions of light years in immense thread-like 
          filaments. Our own galaxy and satellites is a member of the Local Group, 
          which in turn is part of the Virgo Supercluster (or Local Supercluster). 
          The Virgo Supercluster appears to be part of an even larger structure 
          dubbed the Laniakea Supercluster by Brent Tully in 2014. But between 
          these galaxy filaments are vast low-density regions called voids and 
          this is an example of Void Galaxy.</p>
        <p>How isolated is CGCG 409-021? This <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/hubble-views-a-lonely-galaxy">HST 
          press release</a> and image comments <b>&quot;The galaxy is so isolated 
          that if our galaxy, the Milky Way, were to be situated in the same way, 
          we would not even have known of the existence of other galaxies until 
          the development of strong telescopes and detectors in the 1960s.&quot;</b></p>
        <p>At 200x and 375x it appeared as a fairly faint, slightly elongated 
          glow, 24&quot;x20&quot;, with only a weak concentration. A mag 14.2 
          star lies 40&quot; N.<br>
