    <h1>Hydra 1 (<x-dso simbad="ACO 1060">AGC 1060</x-dso>)</h1><img src="assets/agc1060.jpg">
  </center>This is a lovely nearby cluster, only about 165 million light years away. Its central region includes six NGC galaxies brighter than 14th magnitude within a 20 arcminute field. The
  cluster is dominated by a pair of giant ellipticals, <x-dso>NGC 3309</x-dso> and <x-dso>NGC 3311</x-dso>. Also known as Hydra I, <x-dso>Abell 1060</x-dso> is a member of the <a href="superso.htm">Hydra - Centaurus Supercluster.</a>

  </center>N3285 = E501-015 = M-04-25-019<br>
  10 33.6 -27 27<br>
  13: fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated WNW-ESE, small bright nucleus. Located 7' SSW of mag 7.7 <x-dso>SAO 178978</x-dso>. This member of Abell 1060 forms a trio with N3285A 12' WSW and N3285B
  18' SE.
  <p>N3308 = E501-034 = M-04-25-032<br>
  10 36.4 -27 26<br>
  13: fairly faint, small, round, small weak concentration. First of five in a 20' field in the core of Abell 1060.</p>
  <p>N3309 = E501-036 = Abell 1060 = M-04-25-034<br>
  10 36.6 -27 31<br>
  13: moderately bright, small, round. A mag 13.5 star is at the E edge. Forms a close pair with N3311 1.7' E. Second of five in the core of Abell 1060.</p>
  <p>N3311 = E501-038 = M-04-25-036<br>
  10 36.7 -27 32<br>
  13: third of five in the core of Abell 1060. Fairly faint, small, even surface brightness. Appears larger than N3309 1.7' W but with a lower surface brightness. N3312 lies 4.8' SE. Located
  7.7' N of mag 6.8 <x-dso>SAO 179027</x-dso>.</p>
  <p>N3312 = E501-043 = M-04-25-039 = IC 629<br>
  10 37.0 -27 34<br>
  13: fourth of five in the core of Abell 1060. Moderately bright, small, stellar nucleus, elongated 2:1 NNW-SSE. N3311 lies 4.8' NW. Located 7.0' NE of mag 6.8 SAO 179027.</p>
  <p>N3314 = E501-IG046A/B = M-04-25-041<br>
  10 37.2 -27 41<br>
  13: fifth of five in the core of Abell 1060. Fairly faint, small, elongated ~NW-SE. Located 6.8' ESE of mag 6.8 SAO 179027. N3312 lies 7.6' NNW.</p>
