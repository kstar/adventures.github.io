    Spiral with Companion on Arm in Pegasus</h3><img src="assets/arp086.jpg" width="50%">

  23 47.0 +29 28<br>
  13: faint, very small, elongated ~E-W. Forms a close pair with brighter N7753 2' NE. A mag 14 star is 1.2' NE of center and situated between the galaxies.
  <p>N7753 = U12780 = M+05-56-005 = Arp 86 = VV 5<br>
  23 47.1 +29 29<br>
  13: fairly faint, moderately large, weak concentration. A mag 14 star is 0.9' SW of center. Forms a close pair with N7752 2.0' SSW. This is a <x-dso>M51</x-dso>-type system with N7752 at the end of a
  spiral arm.</p>

    <h3>ARP 206 (<x-dso>NGC 3432</x-dso>)<br>
    Galaxy with Irregularities in Leo Minor</h3><img src="assets/arp206.jpg" width="50%">

  10 52.5 +36 37<br>
  17.5: fairly bright, large, edge-on 6:1 SW-NE, 3'x0.5. Irregular surface brightness and fainter on the SW end. Appears to have a sharper light cut-off on the N side (due to dust?). A mag
  12.5 star is 48" E of center and two mag 12/13 star are very close to the SW tip 1.4' from center. The galaxy appears asymetric and brightest just NW of the star near the core although this
  is not the geometric center. Just WSW of this star is a very weak enhancement (this is the core).

  12 01.9 -18 52<br>
  17.5 (4/29/84 and 5/14/88): fairly bright, moderately large. Forms a striking "shrimp-like" or "comma" shape with the tail attached at the E end and extending to the S. Appears clearly
  darker between the two objects on the W side.<br>
  13 (5/21/82): appears as two irregular galaxies connected at the E end.
  <p>N4039 = E572-048 = Ring-Tail galaxy = VV 245 = Antennae = Arp 244b = M-03-31-015<br>
  12 01.9 -18 53<br>
  17.5: this is the southern member of the striking "Ring-Tail galaxy". Attached at the E side of N4038 and forms a "tail" elongated NW-SE.</p>

  17.5: moderately bright, moderately large, elongated 5:2 WSW-ENE, bright core. Forms a pleasing close pair with N3788 (separation of 1.4' NW). The galaxies are elongated at nearly right
  angles and almost attached at the ENE end of N3786. A mag 10.5 star is 2' SE.

  11 39.7 +31 56<br>
  17.5: moderately bright, fairly small, very elongated 3:1 N-S, brighter core. Forms a striking pair of elongated spirals with N3786 1.4' SW which is almost attached at the S end of N3788. A
  mag 10.5 star is 2.7' SE.</p>
