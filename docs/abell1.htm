 17.5: faint but visible without filter at 105x, estimate V = 14.0-14.3.  Can hold with direct vision using an OIII filter.  Appears as a fairly small, round, nice disc at 220x and UHC filter.  Located 5.0' S of mag 8.4 SAO 21680.  Two mag 10 stars are about 2' E and SE of this star.<br>
 13: at 79x and OIII filter appears very faint and can just hold steadily with averted vision, small, round.  Located 5' S of a mag 8.5 star with two mag 9.5 stars near.<p>

 17.5: at 105x and OIII filter appears faint, small, round.  Can hold steadily with averted vision, estimate V = 14.5-14.7.  Nice view at 220x and UHC filter although visible without filter at this power.  Smaller than most Abell planetaries.  Located 40' ESE of M34.<p>

 17.5: Easily picked up at 100x using an OIII filter as a fairly
 faint, round disc. There was a better view at 220x and a UHC filter with the
 25"-30" disc having a crisp edge.  No annularity or interior stars were
 visible.  Also viewed unfiltered as a weak, round glow although filters
 provided a significant contrast gain.  A mag 13.5 star lies 0.9' SSE of
 center.  The PN is situated between two mag 12 stars oriented SW-NE [3.5'
 separation]  and is 5' WSW of an unequal double [mag 10/13 at 11"].<p><hr><p>

 <center><H2>Abell 12 in Orion</H2>
 <img src="images/abell12.jpg" width=50% ></center><p>
 17.5: at 220x and UHC filter; moderately bright, round, moderately large.  Difficult to view as overpowered by glow of mag 4.1 Mu Orionis 1.2' WNW!  Easier at 294x which cleanly separates the pair, estimate V = 12.  Takes 412x which puts more room between Mu and Abell 12.<P>

 <img src="images/abell20.jpg" width=50% ></center><p>
 17.5" (1/12/02): at 100x with an OIII filter this moderately large planetary
appeared very faint, round, evenly lit, crisp-edged. With concentration I
could almost hold it continuously. The magnitude must be fainter than Jack
Marling's computed V = 14.0 (Owen Brazell gives V = 14.7). A mag 10 star lies
3.2' WSW.<br>
13" (12/7/85): extremely faint at 79x and OIII filter, fairly small, round.
Difficult to view and cannot hold steadily with averted, estimate V =
14.5-15. Located 3.3' ENE of a mag 10.5 star.<p><hr><p>

 <a name="abell21"></a>
 <center><H2>Abell 21 in Gemini</H2>
 <img src="images/abell21n.jpg" width=50% ></center><p>
 17.5: at 100x and OIII filter the &quot;Medusa Nebula&quot; appears moderately bright, very large with a distinctive thick &quot;horseshoe&quot; shape open to the W.  The S and SW portion of the rim are brighter and the rim is incomplete on the W and NW side.  A brighter star is embedded in the NE portion of the rim.<br>
 13: 79x with UHC filter; moderately bright, very large, thick partial annulus, incomplete on NW side, brightest on W and SW edge.  Without filter this huge planetary appears faint, diffuse.<br>
 16x80:just visible with OIII filter!<P>
