        <p align="left">On Thursday night, December 1, I met with friends Dennis 
          Beckley and Carter Scholz at Lake Sonoma, our &#147;close-by&#148; observing 
          spot in the rural Sonoma County vineyards, about an hour and half drive 
          from my house in the San Francisco east bay area. Carter was eager to 
          have first light with his new 16-inch Zambuto mirror and Dennis had 
          to check out his new Greg Blandin Cross Bow Platform on his 18-inch 
          Obsession. Observing this time of year often comes with some compromise 
          in terms of conditions. We were fortunate to have clear skies, pretty 
          good transparency, dry conditions (relatively low humidity) and no wind. 
          But seeing was subpar due to the jet stream and that restricted high 
          power viewing.</p>
        <p>Our first target for the night was the insane outburst of Blazar CTA 
          102, a quasar with a redshift of 1.037, implying a light-travel time 
          of nearly 8 billion years. This quasar has a normal quiescent brightness 
          of 17th magnitude but it is known to go into outburst &#151; so it is 
          classified as an Optically Violent Variable (OVV) quasar. It&#146;s 
          in the midst of a historically bright outburst &#151; as super-heated 
          material spiral into the accretion disc surrounding the black hole, 
          an intense magnetic field produces high-energy, relativistic plasma 
          jets. That jet happens to be pointed directly at us, so we are looking 
          down the throat of the jet! CTA 102 appeared marginally brighter than 
          a mag 12.9 star on the AAVSO chart, so perhaps magnitude 12.7 or 12.8. 
          To see an object so relatively bright, whose light has been traveling 
          some 8 billion years to reach us, is humbling.</p>
        <p>A galaxy, NGC 7305, lies less than 6&#146; from the quasar. It was 
          easily seen as a fairly faint, 24&#148; spot with a small bright core 
          and diffuse halo. At a distance of 360 million light years, this is 
          not a nearby galaxy but still 22 times closer than the quasar. It&#146;s 
          nice to get started observing so early this time. By midnight I had 
          observed already 5 hours and had logged 40 objects. Here are some of 
          my favorites.</p>

        <p align="center">Abell Galaxy Cluster (AGC) 2626<br>
          23 36 30.3 +21 08 33</p>
        <p align="left">The 5 brightest members in the central region of AGC 2626 
          were viewed including IC 5336, 5337 and 5338. This cluster lies in Pegasus 
          at a redshift-based distance of nearly 750 million light years!</p>
        <p>IC 5338 is the brightest and largest cluster member (cD class) in AGC 
          2626 and it forms a close pair with IC 5337, the second ranked member, 
          just 1.3' W. I logged IC 5338 as fairly faint, fairly small, round, 
          0.4' diameter, with a small brighter core/nucleus and a low surface 
          brightness halo. IC 5537 appeared fairly faint, small, 20&quot; diameter. 
          This is an edge-on with a length of 0.8', so I must have picked up only 
          the middle section but it was comparable in surface brightness to the 
          bright core of IC 5338. Fainter IC 5336 (a close double system) lies 
          3.8' SW. It was easily the dimmest of these three and seen only with 
          averted vision as a very small, possibly elongated glow, 15&quot; diameter. 
          This is a double system, but only one component was seen with confidence. 
          CGCG 455-028 was picked up 3.5&#146; SE of IC 5338 and noted as very 
          faint, round, 12&quot;-15&quot; diameter, slightly brighter nucleus, 
          low surface brightness. A mag 12.7 star lies 1.3' SSW. Finally, LEDA 
          1644527 was a tiny 10&#148; knot 3.3' NW of IC 5338.</p>

        <p>Using 375x (about the highest power the seeing would allow), the brighter 
          distorted spiral in Arp 70 appeared fairly faint, elongated 5:3 NW-SE, 
          ~30&quot;x18&quot;, broad concentration to center, no distinct nucleus. 
          It forms a close pair with VV 341b 0.8' SW. The companion appeared very 
          faint, very small, slightly elongated 12&quot;x9&quot;. Once identified, 
          it could be held continuously.</p>
        <p>Although Arp classified this system as a &quot;Spiral with a small 
          high surface brightness companion on arm&quot;, the stretched (tidal) 
          northern arm of UGC 934, which hooks south towards VV 341b does not 
          appear to reach the small galaxy.</p>

          galaxies. Arp placed this pair in his classification group of &quot;Elliptical 
          and elliptical-like galaxies, close to and perturbing spirals.&#148; 
          At 260x they were merged into a very faint glow elongated ~WNW-ESE, 
          ~25&quot;x15&#148;. At 375x the glow occasionally &quot;resolved&quot; 
          into two clumps, either connected or within a common halo. The 15&quot; 
          eastern clump was brighter and the 10&quot; western component was extremely 
          faint. A 12&quot; pair of mag 14/14.5 stars is 2.7' S and a mag 13.7 
          star is 2.4' NE.</p>

        <p align="left">Oh my, this galaxy is nearly lost in the glare of 5.7-magnitude 
          10 Arietis. The first challenge is to split the bright star. It&#146;s 
          a mag 5.8/7.9 pair at 1.2&#148;. With a two magnitude difference in 
          brightness it&#146;s a bit tough. But I split it at 280x using an 8&quot; 
          mask on my scope. The galaxy, though, required full aperture!</p>
        <p>Using 225x and 260x it was visible as a fairly faint, round glow, ~20&quot; 
          diameter. Although the surface brightness is surprisingly high, the 
          view was improved with the glare of the star just outside the field, 
          though the galaxy could still be easily seen with the bright star in 
          the field.</p>

        <p align="left">There&#146;s nothing special individually about these 
          three IC galaxies in southwestern Taurus, a region you wouldn&#146;t 
          normally go galaxy hunting. But check out the arrangement surrounding 
          the 8th magnitude star! Quite unique and perhaps worthy of a nickname. 
          The triplet was discovered French astronomer Stephane Javelle in 1891 
          while hunting for &#147;nebulae&#148; with the 30-inch refractor at 
          the Nice Observatory.</p>
        <p>IC 329 was fairly faint, slightly elongated, perhaps 20&quot;x15&#148;. 
          This one is situated 2' WSW of mag 8.3 HD 21926. IC 331 is fairly similar 
          and lies 2.6&#146; E of the star &#150; fairly faint, round, very small 
          bright nucleus. Finally IC 330, 3.9&#146; N of the star, is fairly faint, 
          very elongated WSW-ENE, 30&quot;x10&quot;, small brighter core. A mag 
          11.8 star is 1.4' NNE.</p>

        <p align="left">HIPASS J2351+20 (radio survey designation) is an interacting 
          triplet featuring Markarian (Mrk) 331. Mark 331 is a far infrared (FIR) 
          luminous galaxy with an H II-like optical spectrum. NED classifies it 
          as a LIRG &#151; that&#146;s a Luminous Infrared Galaxy. A LIRG emits 
          one hundred billion times more far-infrared light than our sun does 
          across the entire spectrum. Apparently the huge infrared emission is 
          from starburst activity, perhaps from the interaction.</p>
        <p>Mrk 331 appeared moderately bright, compact, slightly elongated NW-SE, 
          ~0.4'x0.3', small bright nucleus, with a fairly high surface brightness. 
          Much fainter UGC 12812 lies 2&#146; SW and required careful averted 
          to glimpse. It was seen as extremely faint, fairly small, elongated 
          3:1 NNW-SSE, very low even surface brightness.</p>

        <p align="left">This photogenic spiral in Cetus was discovered by William 
          Herschel in 1785 with his workhorse 18.7&#148; speculum reflector. His 
          notes read &quot;pB, L, lE, lbM&#148;, which translates to &#147;pretty 
          bright, large, little elongated, little brighter in the middle.&#148; 
          The Carnegie Atlas of Galaxies describes the photographic appearance 
          as follows: &quot;The beautifully symmetrical grand design in the pattern 
          of NGC 151 contains a smooth central bar which terminates at the place 
          where two inner arms begin. The arms do not spring from the ends of 
          the bar but start from two symmetrically placed points about 15&deg; 
          downstream from the termination of the bar - a common-enough feature...The 
          two principal arms that start at these places relative to the bar, fragment 
          as they move outward and form the multiple-arm pattern in which at least 
          four arm segments can be traced on each side of the galaxy.&#148; Distance 
          measurements place this galaxy at 150 million l.y.</p>
        <p>Through my 24&#148;, NGC 151 appeared bright, fairly large, with a 
          very bright boxy rectangular central section that is slightly elongated 
          NNW-SSE (this is the central bar and nucleus), encased by a fairly low 
          surface brightness halo extended at least 2:1 E-W, ~2.7'x1.2'. A mag 
          12.5 star is at or just off the ENE edge (1.7' from center). A superimposed 
          companion (with the 2MASX designation) is at the tip of the eastern 
          spiral arm of the galaxy, very close southwest of the mag 12.5 star. 
          It was marginally glimpsed but occasionally popped.</p>

        <p align="left">NGC 722 lies a mere 7' SSE from the glare of 2.7-magnitude 
          Beta Aries! This is a very similar situation as NGC 404 (&#147;The Ghost 
          of Mirach&#148;) located 7&#146; from mag 2.1 Beta Andromeda. But NGC 
          404 is magnitude 10.3V, while NGC 722 is magnitude 13.5V, so it&#146;s 
          a much tougher target!!</p>
        <p>It was picked up immediately, though, as a fairly faint glow, elongated 
          3:2 NW-SE, ~30&quot;x20&quot;, with a slightly brighter nucleus. A group 
          of mag 11.5-13 stars is nearby, including a mag 12 star 2.7' ENE.</p>

          UGC 122 is the 21st entry in the Flat Galaxy Catalogue (FGC). The FGC

          40&#148; and a major to minor axis ratio of greater than 7:1. In other 
          words, flat galaxies!</p>
        <p>This one was fairly challenging as it doesn&#146;t have a brighter 
          core and the surface brightness is low. But even worse is the 12th magnitude 
          star just off the west side, which severely hinders the view. Using 
          260x it was seen as an extremely faint, thin edge-on 5:1 WNW-ESE, ~40&quot;x8&#148;. 
          Switching to 375x, I noticed a16th mag star superimposed on the WNW
