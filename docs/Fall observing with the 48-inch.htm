<p>Over the weekend of Halloween (October 30th), Howard Banich and I flew 
          out to El Paso in the early afternoon, picked up a rental car and drove 
          3 hrs to Fort Davis in the remote Davis Mountains, site of the Texas 
          Star Party. The weather had been cloudy earlier in the week but was 
          predicted to clear up on the day of our arrival (Thursday) as well as 
          Friday, but Saturday was listed as partly cloudy and Sunday was predicted 
          to be cloudy and rainy. Still, as I've learned from several trips, the 
          weather near Mt Locke is totally unpredictable as the Davis Mountains 
          strongly affects any incoming systems. The good news around sunset was 
          the skies were perfectly clear. The bad news was a consistent wind. 
          We were able to observe for several hours, but it wasn't comfortable 
          -- the scope was consistently bouncing in the winds, gusts would make 
          observing high on the ladder uncomfortable - particularly when facing 
          into the wind, and seeing was -- as Jimi likes to say &quot;Variable 
          to Terrible&quot;. I believe around 3:00, we finally gave up as there 
          was no sign of the gusts letting up and the seeing was quite soft. Still 
          we did get in some excellent views. The highlights from the first night 
          included NGC 247 (HII regions), NGC 7793 (HII regions), and IC 349 (Barnard's 
          Nebula).</p>
        <p>The second night (Friday) was by far the best night and we observed 
          to 5:00 in the morning, although the seeing was generally only fair. 
          Highlights included resolving stars in M31 (NGC 206), NGC 7656, VV 186 
          = Arp 249, Taffy Galaxies, Arp 251, NGC 891, Taffy II galaxies, Arp 
          78, Zwicky's Triplet, Zwicky's Boomerang, Cas A. The last object we 
          took a look at Comet ISON, which was pretty impressive in the 48-inch, 
          although still 8th magnitude and very low. The third night (Saturday) 
          was clear though a tropical system was expected to arrive late at night. 
          The seeing, though, was fair at best and often poor and around 3:00 
          we started seeing evidence of the front arriving. Highlights included 
          the AM 0003-362 chain (5 galaxies), Burbidge's Chain, Arp 67 (triplet), 
          Arp 295, Eridanus Cluster (globular), NGC 6670 and the filamentary structure 
          in M1.</p>
        <p>Sunday was cloudy as predicted, but Jimi, his wife Connie, Howard and 
          I took a road trip south to spectacular Big Bend National Park. We also 
          had a scenic drive along the Rio Grande river, including a visit to 
          Terlingua, which had just hosted the 48th annual International Chili 
          Cookoff competition the day before.</p>

        <p>NGC 247 spanned at least 18'x5' NNW-SSE, stretching from an HII region 
          at the NNW tip to beyond a mag 9.5 star near the SSE end. An interesting 
          feature is a very large, elongated darker (dusty) region dubbed the 
          &quot;Needle's Eye&quot; on the NNW side, extending at least 3.5'x1.0'. 
          A relatively bright HII knot (identified in NED as MRSS 540-038059 from 
          the &quot;Muenster Red Sky Survey&quot;) is beyond this feature, 9.5' 
          NNW of center. It appeared fairly faint, relatively large for an HII 
          region, elongated ~N-S, 20&quot;x12&quot;. A second well-defined HII 
          knot is MRSS 540-038506, found 5' NNW of center. This easy patch appeared 
          fairly faint, elongated, 15&quot;x10&quot;. At least two small knots 
          (including MRSS 540-038001) are on the SW side of the halo ~2.4' from 
          center and ~1.5' E of a mag 12-12.5 star just off the west edge of the 
          disc. Finally, I picked up a faint, very small knot, ~6&quot; diameter, 
          situated 3.5' SSE of center and 1.1' N of a mag 13.5 star. This HII 
          region (not in the MRSS) forms a &quot;double&quot; with a mag 15 star 
          15&quot; N.</p>

        <p>NGC 7793 is a bright showpiece galaxy in Sculptor, very large, oval 
          3:2 E-W, ~7'x4.5', large bright core. Spiral structure is evident, though 
          it was difficult to trace individual arms except for one better defined 
          arm attached on the west side of the core. This arm sweeps towards the 
          east on the south side of the core (~2' from center) and ends just east 
          of center. The halo is lumpy with an irregular surface brightness and 
          several HII knots/associations are visible. The brightest individual 
          knot is [H69] #20, from Paul Hodge's 1969 paper &quot;HII Regions in 
          20 Nearby Galaxies&quot;, a fairly faint, 10&quot; knot that was easily 
          seen 1.5' S of center, near the south side of the halo. [H69] #27, a 
          slightly smaller and fainter patch is near the WNW end of the halo (1.9' 
          from center). On the WSW side of the halo are two additional close, 
          faint knots, both ~8&quot; in diameter; [H69] #32 situated 2.3' from 
          center and [H69] #33 at 2.4' from center. Finally, [H69] #3/#5 is a 
          fairly faint, 15&quot; patch near the NW edge of the halo, 2.8' from 
          center. A mag 12.5 star is just off the northern edge, 2.9' from center.</p>

        <p>We examined the large association NGC 206 carefully for resolved stars 
          using the finder chart in Stephen Odewahn's 1987 study &quot;A photometric 
          survey of the rich OB association NGC 206 in M31&quot;. The 6 or 7 brightest 
          members down to V = 17.6 were carefully identified with the brightest 
          member #12 (V = 16.1) at the north edge relatively prominent. Then just 
          scanning over the cloud with averted vision, roughly 20 additional extremely 
          faint stars popped in and out of view, mimicking the appearance of a 
          partially resolved globular cluster! Based on photometry in the paper, 
          these extended down to approximately V = 18.3-18.5. The cloud, itself, 
          was quite irregular and split up into several slightly brighter patches. 
          I've labeled some of the brighter members which were individually identified 
          on the chart.</p>

        <p>NGC 7656: at 488x and 610x appeared fairly faint to moderately bright, 
          round, ~24&quot; diameter, high surface brightness. Surprisingly, a 
          low surface brightness wing or loop extending to the northeast was immediately 
          noticed. This loop is brighter along the northern edge and passes through 
          a mag 16.7 star (or stellar galaxy), increasing the overall length to 
          45&quot; extending southwest (core) to northeast (loop). A mag 16.5 
          star lies 1.3' W and another mag 16.5 star is 1.4' N. 2MASX J23242536-1902139, 
          an extremely compact galaxy (V = 15.7) lies 1.9' NW. Finally, 2MASX 
          J23243030-1903019, an extremely faint quasi-stellar galaxy was glimpsed 
          less than 30&quot; NNW, although another loop in that direction was

        <p>VV 186 = Arp 249 was clearly resolved into two cores at 488x, encased

        <p>UGC 12914 and 12915, known as the &quot;Taffy Galaxies&quot; was observed 
          at 610x. UGC 12914 (southwestern component) appeared bright, fairly

          a very bright, rounder core. The southern end of the galaxy gradually 
          faded out and extended further than seen with my 24&quot;. A dust lane 
          creates a sharp light-cut off on the east side of the core and the diffuse 
          glow from an arm is visible further east. A bright curving spiral arm 
          is attached on the NNW side of the core and it hooks north counterclockwise 
          towards the companion UGC 12915. The arms from both galaxies nearly 
          merged in an embrace, but did not connect. A mag 13 star is just off 
          the SE end. UGC 12915, smaller, northeastern component appeared fairly

          brightness but extending noticeably further than the ESE arm and increasing 
          the major axis to 0.8' or 0.9'. A mag 16 star is superimposed near the 
          ESE end. UGC 816 appeared moderately to fairly bright, moderately large, 
          very elongated 5:2 or 3:1 roughly N-S. Well concentrated with a small 
          bright core that increases to a quasi-stellar nucleus. Extending from

          These dimensions refer to the core and with more careful viewing, very

        <p>At 375x, Zwicky's &quot;Boomerang&quot; galaxy appeared as a very faint, 
          fairly small, thin boomerang shape, elongated E-W. The galaxy curves

          has an fairly even, low surface brightness with no core, the western 
          tip is slightly brighter. A mag 16.5 star is barely off the east tip. 
          Increasing the magnification to 610x and then 813x provided an excellent

          slightly at both tips. There was a strong impression of several stellar 
          quasi-stellar knots along the length. The mag 16.5 star was cleanly

        <p>The supernova remnant Cas A was one of the highlights this trip on 
          the 48&quot;. We used 488x and a NPB filter to examine this SNR carefully. 
          Immediately I noticed the nebula was much more extensive and detailed 
          than previous views. The glow extending roughly 2.4'x0.8' E-W (twice 
          the size seen previously) with the brightest section on the eastern 
          half. At the west end the nebulosity faded and thinned as it curved 
          WSW of a mag 13.5 star. The eastern half was quite irregular and brightest 
          near the eastern end, where a couple of stars are involved. A very faint, 
          but distinct filament (not seen previously) is attached at the east 
          end and also extends E-W, just south of the main section by ~30&quot;. 
          Overall, Cas A had a weak filamentary structure as opposed to a smooth
