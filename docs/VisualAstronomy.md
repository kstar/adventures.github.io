title: Introduction to Visual Astronomy 
author: Vishal Kasliwal

Visual Astronomy is the act of observing astronomical objects visually in real-time, i.e. with one's eyes as opposed to studying an image captured by a detector
such as a CCD. Since the advent of the photographic plate, visual astronomy has primarily become the domain of the amateur astronomer although discoveries continue to be made visually, e.g. novae, supernovae, observations of variable stars, comets, etc... Here, we shall review some of the basic theory of visual astronomy. Most of the material presented here may also be found elsewhere - our goal is to collate the information into one cohesive whole...

## Physical Properties of Light
Electromagnetic radiation, or light, consists of waves of the electromagnetic field which propagate through spacetime at the speed of light, $$c = 3 \times 10^{8} \textrm{m/s}$$, and carry both momentum as well as electromagnetic radiant energy. Electromagnetic field waves can be produced by a number of physical processes such as thermal processes, orbital transitions of electrons in atoms, molecular exicitations, bremsstrahlung, etc... From a quantum mechanical perspective, light consists of massless particles known as photons that possess energy and momentum.

Light is characterized by its wavelength, measured in $$\textrm{m}$$, and frequency, measured in $$\mathrm{Hz}$$ or $$\mathrm{t^{-1}}$$. In a vaccuum, the wavelength of light is related to its frequency by

$$\lambda = \frac{c}{\nu}$$

## Telescopes
Telescopes are characterized by their apertue, $$d_{T}$$, and focal-length, $$f_{T}$$. The ratio of the focal-length to aperture, $$N = f_{T}/d_{T}$$, is 
known as the focal-ratio or f-number of the telescope and is written as $$f/N$$ by convention. For example, a telescope of aperture $$508 \mathrm{mm}$$ and
focal-length $$2509 \mathrm{mm}$$, i.e. $$N = 4.94$$, has f-number $$f/4.94$$.
