title: Introduction to Visual Astronomy 
author: Vishal Kasliwal

Visual Astronomy is the act of observing astronomical objects visually, i.e. with one's eyes as opposed to a detector such as a CCD. Since the advent
of the photographic plate, visual astronomy has primarily become the domain of the amateur astronomer although discoveries continue to be made visually, e.g. 
novae, supernovae, observations of variable stars, comets, etc... Here, we shall review some of the basic theory of visual astronomy. Most of the material
presented here may also be found elsewhere - our goal is to collate the information into one chesive whole...

##Telescopes
Telescopes are characterized by their apertue, $$d_{T}$$, and focal-length, $$f_{T}$$. The ratio of the focal-length to aperture, $$N = f_{T}/d_{T}$$, is 
known as the focal-ratio or f-number of the telescope and is written as $$f/N$$ by convention. For example, a telescope of aperture $$500 mm $$ and
focal-length $2509 mm$ has f-number $f/4.94$.
