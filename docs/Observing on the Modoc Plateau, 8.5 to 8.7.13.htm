          <p align="left">Last week (Aug 5-7), I joined Dennis Beckley, Ken Archuleta and Rick Linden for 3 nights at Likely Place Golf/RV resort (likelyplace.com). Likely is in the
          northeastern corner of the state, 17 miles south of Alturas on the Modoc Plateau at 4600 ft (about an hour east of the GSSP site). Dennis had made arrangements to stay at their
          3-bedroom "Villa", with a fully equipped kitchen, comfortable living room, 1 1/2 baths and a covered deck looking out towards the Warner Mountains (highest peak nearly 10,000 ft). I
          knew about this location as it is the site of an annual star party hosted by StellarVue (http://stellarvue.com/Stellartrips/dssp2011/dssp2011.html ) and Tony Hallas had described
          had enthusiastically praised the site in an Astronomy magazine article (can be downloaded at likelyplace.com/attractions/#stargazing). Tony was also there imaging on Monday night
          and talked to us quite a bit about the site and local attractions.</p>
          <p align="left">On Wednesday afternoon, we drove up into the nearby hills and hiked around the South Warner Wildnerness area visiting Mill Creek Falls (http://tinyurl.com/kjfwpl4)
          and nearby Clear Lake. Another short drive to us to beautiful Blue Lake (http://tinyurl.com/mplw3xy). Besides stargazing, if you're into hiking, fishing and golf, this spot has it
          all.</p>
          <p align="left">Of the 3 nights we were there, Monday was the best as a weather system from the south moved in on Tuesday and we were completely clouded out (we did sit outside and
          admire the distant lightening). Wednesday also looked bleak, but the predictions were for the clouds to clear out in the evening and this time the forecast was right on schedule. We
          had another clear night (though with somewhat decreased transparency), with clouds not rolling in again until after 3:00AM. SQM readings were in the 21.55-21.7 range for me, though
          Rick had one in the high 21.7s. This is better than I've generally seen at the GSSP site (Adin). Seeing, though, started off poor and was somewhat soft all night, at least at the
          375x I was using on galaxies, so although the skies were excellent (just inside a black light pollution region), some details were probably lost in the variable seeing.</p>
          <p align="left">As a treat, two "bright" supernovae were on display - a mag 13 type Ia supernova (SN 2013dy) in <x-dso>NGC 7250</x-dso> and a mag 12.5 type II supernova (SN 2013ej) in <x-dso>M74</x-dso>.
          Although I've seen dozens of SN over the years, I don't recall having two relatively prominent ones visible at the same time. Here are some of the other highlights from both nights
          using my 24-inch f/3.7 Starstructure. Images are either from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) or www.wikisky.org (combined blue/red POSS)</p>

            <p align="left">After hearing that Gyulbudaghian's Nebula (GM 1-29) had brightened and was now visible again after several years of disappearance (since roughly 2006), it was high
            on my observing list for Likely Golf/RV Resort. It was immediately picked up at 200x as a faint, elongated glow, fanning somewhat (though not as much as I remember from '03) and
            extending NNE for ~25". There was slight brightening at the SSW tip, which contains the obscured Herbig Ae pre-main sequence star PV Cep, but as opposed to the earlier
            observation, PV Cep was not visible. A box or parallelogram asterism consisting of 4 mag 10-13 star is directly east, including a mag 10.5 star 2.4' ESE. This is an unusual H-H
            object, consisting of a variable reflection nebula or jet extending from the young, pre-main-sequence star PV Cephei. The nascent star is surrounded by a rotating circumstellar
            disk of material. At right angles to this disk are two jets of material, streaming away from the star at high speeds. One of these jets is visible (the other is obscured) on the
            north side as a stream of material intersects the surrounding gas in the interstellar medium. A 2012 paper provides evidence in support of a direct correlation between changes in
            the light output of the star and the brightness of the nebula.</p>

          Fairly faint nebulous glow immediately picked up at 200x, extending southeast from 12th magnitude V1982 = LKHa 324. The glow is ~2:1 WNW-ESE and roughly 1.0'x0.5' in size. At the
          southeast end is a very faint "star" (LKHa 324SE), which generally appears stellar at 325x but sometimes appeared quasi-stellar. A mag 13.7 star is 1.7' E and a 15.5 star is 1.2'
          SE. The field to the west is mostly devoid of very faint stars (dark nebula), but includes mag 6.4 <x-dso>HD 200740</x-dso> 8' NW. LBN 408, a faint reflection nebula, surrounds a mag 11 star 8.6'
          WSW. See the paper "The Preâ€“Main-Sequence Population of L988" at iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/131/3/1530/pdf/05011.web.pdf</p>

          This trio of galaxies from the Karachentseva catalogue of "Isolated Triplets of Galaxies" forms an 8' equilateral triangle. <x-dso>NGC 6956</x-dso> = KTG 7A, at the NW vertex, appeared moderately
          or fairly bright, elongated ~3:2 NW-SE, 60"x40". The view is somewhat hampered by a mag 11 star that is superimposed on the east edge and a mag 14.5 star is ~20" E of the bright
          star. Appears to be a barred spiral with a brighter bar oriented ~N-S extending down the middle of the glow. A brighter nucleus in the center of the bar is quasi-stellar (~5") and
          similar to the mag 14.5 star in brightness. A faint extension (spiral arm) curves east from the south end of the bar, extending south of the mag 11 star. Brightest in a trio (KTG
          71) with <x-dso>UGC 11620</x-dso> 6.9' SE and <x-dso>UGC 11634</x-dso> 8.1' E. Located in a rich Milky Way star field 3.7' SSW of a mag 9.6 star. UGC 11620 = KTG 71B is the second brightest member and appeared
          faint/fairly faint, small, elongated 3:2 SSW-NNE, 21"x14". Two mag 13/14 stars are off the SE end and a mag 15.5 star is near the NNE end [22" from center]. Finally, <x-dso>UGC 11623</x-dso> = KTG
          71C, at the eastern vertex of the triangle, appeared fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 5:3 SW-NE, 36"x20", a small brighter core is embedded in a fairly smooth halo. A small
          trio of mag 13/14.5.15 stars is close preceding and a mag 10 star 5' S forms the vertex of an isosceles right triangle with UGC 11623 and 11620.</p>

          Although I had previously worked through this Abell cluster twice with my 17.5" and 18" scopes, it was covered by Ken Hewitt-White in the current issue of Sky & Tel, and I revisted
          the cluster again. <x-dso>NGC 7768</x-dso>, the dominant member, appeared moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 3:2 WSW-ENE, 0.9'x0.6', contains a bright core with a very small brighter
          nucleus. A mag 13.5 star is superimposed west of the core, just 13" from the center. A mag 11 star (GR Peg) lies 2.6' ENE. Surrounded by a number of faint galaxies including a N-S
          string of 4 galaxies to the north (with an additional 4 nearby). Another group of 3 or 4 galaxies (including <x-dso>NGC 7765</x-dso>, 7766, and 7767) are also arranged in a N-S string close west,
          so most of the cluster is in a 12' N-S chain. A total of 13 galaxies were logged.</p>

          This is the brightest of 11 NGC galaxies in Aquila. Fairly bright, fairly large, round, ~1.5' diameter. Well concentrated with a bright core that increases to a very bright nucleus.
          A mag 13 star lies 1' NW and two mag 14/14.4 star are a bit further northeast. Spiral structure is evident in the halo with an ill-defined segment of a curving arm on the east side
          and a counterpart on the west side. A very faint star (V = 15.6) is superimposed on the western arm.</p>

          This large M31 stellar association was immediately picked up at 125x as a faint, fairly large patch with an ill-defined edge, though definitely elongated ~2.5'x1.5' SW-NE. The
          contrast was fairly low as A54 is embedded along the NE edge of M31 and glow from the galaxy merges to the east. With extended viewing at 200x the contrast varied - sometimes the
          glow was barely discerned and other times fairly obvious. Two mag 14/14.5 stars are just off the NW side and a mag 14 star is right along the eastern edge. There was a slight
          brightening noted near the SW end and at this position on the DSS are a couple of close mag 16 stars.</p>

        Cygnus A is a powerful radio source roughly 750 million light-years distant and containing a quasar in the core. This is the first discovered and closest powerful radio galaxy
        (brightest extragalactic radio-emitting source in sky). It contains two powerful radio lobes separated by some 400,000 light years. Wolfgang Steinicke has a nice write-up at
        http://www.klima-luft.de/steinicke/Artikel/cyga/cyga_e.htm and Bill Keel has information at http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/agn/cygnusa.html. I've looked for this hidden giant previously
        with my 18" and was unsuccessful. This time with my 24", it was picked up at 375x as an extremely faint and small glow, round, ~8" diameter (viewed nucleus only). Visible over 50% of
        the time with concentration but too faint to hold steadily. This challenging radio galaxy is squeezed between a mag 12.5-13 star just 30" W and a mag 14.3 star 20" E within a rich
        Milky Way field.</td>
