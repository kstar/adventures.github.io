    <h1>Centaurus Cluster (RCG 3526)</h1><img src="images/centaurus.gif">
  </center>Although it is possible to observe the Centaurus Cluster from northern California, as you can see from Steve's observing notes, my best view by far was at the Texas Star Party a
  few years back. This is a large bright nearby (150 million light years) cluster that includes ten NGC galaxies within a one degree field. The brightest member is the 11th magnitude
  elliptical NGC 4696. Along with the IC4329 Cluster and Hydra I (AGC 1060), the Centaurus Cluster is part of the <a href="superso.htm">Hydra - Centaurus Supercluster.</a>
