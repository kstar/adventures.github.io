17.5: at 82x with Hß filter the Cocoon Nebula appears fairly bright, very large, about 10' diameter.  Surrounds six stars including two bright mag 9 stars embedded near the center and at the S edge.  Has an irregular round shape with a very irregular surface brightness with dark mottling and brighter regions.  Quite prominent using Hß filter which has an excellent contast gain!  Superimposed on a scattered star group.  Located at the E end of long dark lane = B186 which extends 1° WNW!  There is a distinctive edge to the milky way on the N edge of lane.  Unusual as higher contrast gain with Hß than OIII filter.<p>
8: about 20 stars over a very faint "milky" region, fairly large, just slightly higher contrast than milky way background.  A short arc of stars
is off the W edge.  A long starless dark lane extends W.  Two bright stars oriented N-S are just E. - Steve Gottlieb<p>
