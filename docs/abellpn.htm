It's particulary exciting to find a deep sky object that has only been discovered in the last half century. Maybe that's because you know that not many other people have ever <i>seen</i> it!  One of the most significant lists of such objects is George Abell's <i>Catalog of Planetary Nebulae</i>, objects discovered on plates from the Palomar Sky Survey in the mid-1950s.<p>

<h1>Three Easy Abell Planetaries</h1></center>



<i>Bet you thought there wasn't such a thing as an easy Abell planetary. These little gems weren't even discovered until George Abell had a careful look at the Palomar Sky Survey in the 1950s. By "easy" I don't mean easy to see, at least not in a small telescope. (I highly recommend an OIII filter, no matter what size scope you're using.) But they should be easy to find, because they lie near bright, well-known objects. I have Steve Gottlieb to thank for first showing me all three.</i>--Jim Shields







<a href="abell1.htm#abell04"><h3>Abell 04</h3></a>



<p>This compact planetary lies only 40 arcminutes east-southeast of open cluster M34 in western Perseus. From a bright 7th-magnitude star in the southeastern part of the cluster it's an easy star hop along a string of 10th-magnitude stars to a pair of stars of about the same brightness. The planetary is just northwest of these stars. Can you spot it? (Don't miss the tiny galaxy just a few arcminutes further northwest.)







<a href="abell1.htm#abell12"><h3>Abell 12</h3></a>



<p>This is one of my favorite Abell planetaries because it is so unexpected! To find it first locate Mu Orionis, a 4th-magnitude bluish star about three degrees northeast of Betelgeuse. Then pop in a high power eyepiece with an OIII filter. All but lost in the glare, and just northwest of the star itself, you may be able to spot a faint circular patch a bit more than half an arcminute wide. That's it!







<a href="abell4.htm#abell82"><h3>Abell 82</h3></a>



<p>This large soft planetary lies near NGC 7789, a wonderful open cluster in western Cassiopeia that is on many observers' list of favorites. Look for a pair of 6th-magnitude stars about a degree and a half west-northwest of the cluster. The planetary lies about half a degree south of the reddish easternmost star of the two and forms a right triangle with them. Look for its brighter southeastern edge.







<p>Two other Abell planetaries you won't want to miss are Abell 21 in Gemini and Abell 70 in Aquila. 



<a href="abell1.htm#abell21">Abell 21</a> ,also known as the Medusa Nebula, is the crown jewel of the Abell catalog, a large bright horseshoe of light in a 17.5-inch scope with an OIII filter. 



<a href="abell3.htm#abell70">Abell 70</a> is fainter and tougher to find, but worth the search, because it combines an overlapping galaxy and nebula. The edge-on galaxy along the planetary's northern edge is much the brighter of the two and actually appears to lie in front of the nebula!
