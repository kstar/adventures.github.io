    <h1>Certificates Awarded</h1><i>AINTNO #95 - Retired by Riku Henriksson and Markus Tuukkanen</i>
  </center>
  <p><i>Hey, Barbara</i></p>
  <p><i>I don't know if you heard already, but last night Markus Tuukkanen and I managed to observe the optical afterglow of gamma ray burst GRB030329 visually. It's located in Leo and it was
  at the moment of magnitude 14.2. As there's entry 95: "Optical counterpart of any gamma burst. (No space junk, please.)" in AINTNO catalogue I believe you should seriously consider granting
  us the coveted AINTNO certificate.</i><br>
  Riku Henriksson</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Riku:<br>
  The Aintno Committee has proudly accepted your observation of Aintno #95 "Optical counterpart of any gamma burst. (No space junk, please.)" See reply from Larry Mitchell enclosed. Larry
  says you have to come to TSP to get the certificate. Where we will give you the Aintno Certificate #5.<br>
  I am inclined to make you a virtual Aintno Certificate until you can come to receive the real one. Here is what you do: Turn your computer power saving function on. Go into standby mode.
  Let screen go black. Stare at screen with averted vision. This is a simulated Aintno Certificate!<br>
  Seriously, send me your address. Will create and mail this "dubious document" to you and Markus. Congratulations for being only 5/6th people in the world to qualify for the "coveted" (your
  words) AINTNO. And in all seriousness, you guys did a heck of a job. I am just sorry I wasn't there to see it.<br>
  Barbara Wilson<br>
  Aintno Committee</p>
  <p>And Larry's reply:<br>
  Barbara,<br>
  This truly is a significant feat and certainly worth a piece of black paper - They have to come get it however...... TSP is just around the corner. We also don't know what Mr. O'Meara has
  up his sleeve yet? The Aintno just goes on and on and on and on and on and onandonandonandonandon.....WOW!!!<br>

  <p>Honorable Mentions go to Tim Parson of the Minnesota Astronomical Society and Tom Bakowski of the Buffalo Astronomical Association, who also submitted observations of Aintno #95.</p>

    <i>AINTNO #46 - Retired by Tim Parson</i>
  </center>
  <p>We have awarded AINTNO Certificate #4 for object #46 (any galaxy within one degree of the Horsehead) to Tim Parson of the Minnesota Astronomical Society at the 2002 Texas Star Party. Tim
  successfully observed Mac galaxy 0538-0223 43.6' away from the Horsehead. I have visually confirmed his observation in both my 20" and in a 13.1" telescope from West Texas. Larry and I are
  very pleased to award this to Tim as it was the first real AINTNO to fall without trickery, a <i>real</i> observation with an amateur size telescope. Here is Tim's message about his
  observation:</p>
  <p><i>Dear AINTNO Representatives:</i></p>
  <p><i>In the fall of 1999, I once again put the AINTNO list under a microscope and found that #46 (from the revised list) seemed to be a little bit suspicious. It read: "Any galaxy within 1
  degree of the Horsehead", so right away I booted up Megastar and found out that Larry listed three Mac galaxys within one degree of the Horsehead:</i></p>
  <p><i>Mac galaxy 0540-0240 15.0' away from the Horsehead in a P.A. of 211.2 degrees at R.A. 05 40 22.5 DEC. -02 40 52<br>
  Mac galaxy 0538-0233 36.5' away from the Horsehead in a P.A. of 261.4 degrees at R.A. 05 38 29.3 Dec. -02 33 28<br>
  Mac galaxy 0538-0223 43.6' away from the Horsehead in a P.A. of 275.4 degrees at R.A. 05 38 00.0 Dec. -02 23 51</i></p>
  <p><i>Looking at the DSS images, Mac galaxy 0540-0240 seemed to be nonexistent and therefore almost impossible to observe. Mac galaxy 0538-0233 could be observed with a fairly large
  telescope under dark skies. The bright stars to the southeast will hamper the view a bit, but I still think it's doable. Mac galaxy 0538-0223 offered the biggest surprise. This galaxy
  reminded me of some faint NGC galaxy with a small bright core and faint arms.</i></p>
  <p>The galaxy seemed so bright, in fact that I attempted it in my little 14.5" telescope from home (I live 25 miles north northeast of the Twin Cities). The first two times I tried for it
  at home I came away empty handed at 274x. I tried for it one more time on 10/08/99 armed with a new eyepiece, a Takahashi LE 5mm (384x). I bought this eyepiece over all other eyepieces
  after only one view through Barbara Wilson's 20" telescope at the 1999 Texas Star Party. I was looking at <x-dso>Pal 5</x-dso> when the whole field came alive with a faint sprinkling of stars over the
  face of this faint globular cluster. <i>It was almost like a religious experience! Thank you, Barbara!</i></p>
  <p>The eyepiece really did the trick because when I put it in I was able to see a very faint glow of light just to the northeast of a grouping of 5 or 6 stars of about 14.7 to 15.7
  magnitude. The galaxy could at times be held with averted vision and sometimes with an elongated shape. This would have to be one of the brighter Mac galaxies I've seen!</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Brian Skiff and Tom Polakis share AINTNO certificate #1/2.</p>
  <p>Steve O'Meara has AINTNO certificate #1 for his observation of the G Ring of Saturn (original AINTNO object 31 now revised to "Braids in the F Ring of Saturn") Stephen said he observed
  the G Ring during the ring plane crossing of Saturn during 1995 with the 36? Lick Observatory Refractor.</p>
  <p>Amelia Goldberg has AINTNO Certificate #2.5 for object #100: the arrow that points to Pluto</p>
  <p>Steve O"Meara has AINTNO Certificate #3 for "an elliptical galaxy seen naked eye" (object #54 on the Original AINTNO list now revised by "any protostar") We only gave him 1/2 a
  certificate because of our argument that Centaurus A is not truly a "naked eye elliptical". See message from Steve below:</p>
  <p><i>From: Stephen James OMeara<br>
  To: Barbara Wilson<br>
  Nice job. How fun! I'm glad to see the list hasn't changed all that much...so be prepared, because I "aim to claim" another AINTNO; by the way, you forgot to mention that I too have an
  AINTNO 1/2 certificate for my naked-eye sighting of Centaurus A -- that naked-eye elliptical. :-)</i></p>
