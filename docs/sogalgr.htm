    <h1>Exploring the Southern Sky:<br>
    Part IV - Two Southern Galaxy Groups</h1>
    <h2>by Steve Gottlieb</h2>
  </center>This is the fourth part in a series based on my trip to Australia last summer, covering observations of a few southern showpiece objects. The other parts in the series are:<br>
  <a href="soglob.htm">Southern Globular Clusters</a><br>
  <a href="soplan.htm">Southern Planetaries</a><br>
  <a href="sogal.htm">Southern Galaxies</a>
  <p>Here are a couple of interesting galaxy groups that I checked out last July while observing at the Magellan Observatory (Lake Bathurst) in Australia with an 18" NGT. The Pavo group first
  caught my attention with an image in the ESO pictorial atlas "Exploring the Southern Sky" (1987) - particularly the disturbed barred spiral <x-dso>NGC 6872</x-dso>. David Frew added the group to the
  second edition of Hartung's Astronomical objects for southern telescopes" and included an image with the AAT. The cluster is pretty compact and 8 members fit in a 20' field with a 9 Nagler.
  I had no problems identifying the members using the images as finder charges, so I took the time to view the group carefully on two different evenings. At -70 degrees declination, this is
  strictly a southern skies target, but if you have the opportunity don't bypass the Pavo group.</p>
  <p>The Telescopium group is much looser and spread out over a degree. It's also 22 degrees further north (-48 dec) and accessable from extreme southern sites in the U.S. In fact, I first
  picked off the brighter members with a C-8 in July of '91, while I was at the tip of Baja for the solar eclipse, so I wanted to have another look with the cluster riding high in the sky.
  Hartung mentions the brightest member, <x-dso>NGC 6868</x-dso>, can be picked up with a 4" scope (from dark skies in Victoria, Australia) and it was easy in a C-8 from Baja. A couple of the members,
  though, were challenging in the 18" near Lake Bathurst in New South Wales including <x-dso>NGC 6861B</x-dso> = ESO 233-026 and an anonymous member at 20 06 29.1 -48 19 43 (not in PGC or NED).</p>

  <p>N6872 = E073-IG032 = VV 297a = AM 2011-705 20 16 56.9 -70 46 04 V = 11.8; Size 6.0x1.5; SB = 14.0; PA = 66d<br>
  18" (7/10/02): second brightest in the Pavo Group with brightest member N6876. This huge barred spiral (with excessively distended arms spanning roughly 750,000 light years) appeared
  moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 2:1 SW-NE in the direction of a mag 10.4 star 1.1' WSW of center, ~1.2'x0.6', broad concentration with a brighter core. Interacting with <x-dso>IC 4970</x-dso>
  at 1.1' N just outside the halo while fainter <x-dso>PGC 64439</x-dso> lies 4.0' SE. Other members of the group include N6876, N6877, N6880.<br>
  18" (7/8/02): moderately bright, elongated 2:1 SW-NE toards a mag 10.5 star off the SW edge, 1.2'x0.5'. Fairly well concentrated with a small bright<br>
  core. In 1979 A&amp;A, 79, 22, the abstract for "NGC 6872 - A remarkable barred spiral" mentions "The extent of the arms is probably greater than in any other spiral known; it is concluded
  that NGC 6872 is a conventional barred spiral in which severe tidal interaction took place." See <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap990525.html" target=
  "_blank">http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap990525.html</a> for VLT image.</p>

  from the center. N6877 lies 4.4' W.<br>

  galaxy. Brightest of 4 galaxies in field with IC 4943 8.5' W, N6861B 14' SW and an anonymous galaxy 2.8' N of IC 4943. This is one of the brighter galaxies in the Telescopium Group = AS
  851.<br>
