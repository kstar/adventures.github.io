  <p>The Michelin Green Guide to Rome lists thousands of objects to see, perhaps 8000 like the NGC. Similarly for Fodor's Guide. I see people checking off these objects (paintings,
  sculptures, fountains, streets, etc.) in their guidebooks, one by one, until they have seen all 8000. As for me, I sit in the Piazza Navona, perhaps the greatest urban square in the world,
  and sip expresso. These object-oriented people count the cracks in the cobblestones, probably, while I drink in, so to speak, the Bernini Fountains and watch the artists and listen to the
  street musicians.</p>
  <p>Sometimes I sip expresso in the Piazza del Pantheon, opposite the oldest building still in use in the world. Recently, using a guidebook, I found a little church a block away that had an
  elephant sculpture on a pedestal, probably two thousand years old, in front of it. In the church were some statues. I paid attention to the one by Michelangelo, of Christ carrying the
  cross, which has some of the feel of his David, in Florence.</p>
  <p>Sometimes I go to the Spanish Steps, possibly the most beautiful set of stairs in the world. Or I walk through the Piazza del Campidoglio, perfectly proportioned, designed by
  Michelangelo. Or I go to the Trevi Fountains and listen to the young Italian people sing and play the guitar in the moonlight.</p>
  <p>Although I see some new things every time I go to Rome, I will never see or try to see the 8000 things in the Guidebook, nor even the Michelin 400 I or the Michelin 400 II, if there are
  such things. And I will never place checkmarks in my guidebook to indicate objects found and conquered. I may eventually and unintentionally see 800 "objects" or "sights" in Rome, depending
  on how you count, in fact I may have already, but I won't know it and I won't be counting and I won't be using anyone else's list and I won't be working toward a certificate.</p>
  <p>But I will be having yet another expresso in the Piazza Navona, the Piazza del Pantheon, and similar places, and drinking in the atmosphere and the feeling of Rome and its people.</p>
  <p>Just my way of doing things.</p>
