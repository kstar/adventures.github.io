          <p>On the first night (October 3, 2013) of the Calstar gathering at Lake San Antonio (<a href="http://lakesanantonioresort.com/">http://lakesanantonioresort.com/</a>), I decided to
          work mainly on KTS triplets. This catalogue contains 76 isolated triplets, all south of -3 degrees declination, that was compiled in 2000 by Russian astronomers V.E. Karachentseva
          and I.D. Karachentsev. The objects were selected using ESO/SERC and POSS-I sky survey plates. Roughly half of these triplets (designated KTS 1, KTS 2, etc.) are accessible from
          sites in northern or central California, while the other half requires a trip further south (preferably the southern hemisphere!). The first object I looked at, though, is Hickson
          Compact Group (HCG) 99, which is located much further north in Pegasus. The images are either from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) or the DSS from WikiSky. All observing notes
          were made with my 24-inch f/3.7 Starstructure, generally at 375x unless noted otherwise.</p>

          <p><x-dso>HCG 99B</x-dso> = UGC 12899 is the brightest of 5 members in HCG 99. At 375x it appeared moderately bright, fairly small, round, 30" diameter, increases evenly to a brighter
          quasi-stellar nucleus. <x-dso>HCG 99C</x-dso> = CGCG 499-33 is attached at the west end [40" between centers] and was easily seen as a faint to fairly faint glow, elongated 5:2 E-W, 30"x12", with
          a slightly brighter nucleus. <x-dso>HCG 99A</x-dso> = UGC 12897 has a mag 11.5 star attached at the south end which detracts from viewing, but this is the largest member of the quintet. It
          appeared fairly faint, fairly small, very elongated 3:1 N-S, ~40"x13". The two faintest members, <x-dso>HCG 99D</x-dso> and 99E, were both extremely faint and small, roundish. 99D was slightly
          larger at 10" with 99E just a very dim 6" glow.</p>

          moderately bright, fairly large, edge-on 5:1 nearly N-S, 1.5'x0.3', sharply concentrated with a small, bright elongated core increasing to a stellar nucleus. NGC 172 was fairly
          faint, moderately large, edge-on SSW-NNE, 0.9'x0.2', irregular surface brightness. NGC 168 appeared fairly faint, moderately large, edge-on 5:1 SSW-NNE, 40"x8", broad weak
          concentration. A mag 10.4 star lies 5.5' N.</p>

          bright, moderately large, irregular, ~0.9'x0.7'. A very faint extension was repeatedly visible on the SE end protruding towards the east. This asymmetry is confirmed on the DSS,
          which reveals a chaotic system with knots. A wide pair of mag 13 stars is less than 2' SW. <x-dso>IC 233</x-dso> appeared fairly faint to moderately bright, fairly small, oval 3:2 NW-SE, broad
          concentration, 30"x20". Forms the vertex of a triangle with a mag 11.5 star 1.8' N and a mag 12.5 star 2.5' ENE. Finally, NGC 907 was moderately to fairly bright, fairly large, very
          elongated 3:1 E-W, 1.5'x0.5'. Irregular surface brightness and clearly brighter on the east side.</p>

          companion <x-dso>UGC 11658</x-dso> was faint, very small, round, 15" (core only). A mag 15.7 star lies directly between the galaxies.</p>

          <p>28 galaxies were observed in this group, which is part of the Pisces-Perseus Supercluster. The field in the image is dominated by NGC 499 which appeared fairly bright, moderately
          large, elongated 4:3 WSW-ENE, 60"x45", well concentrated with a very bright core. Nearby are <x-dso>NGC 498</x-dso> 1.8' N, <x-dso>NGC 501</x-dso> 2.8' SE, NGC 498 3.4' WNW and <x-dso>NGC 496</x-dso> 4.2' N. Perhaps the
          faintest NGC galaxy is 498, discovered with the 72-inch of Lord Rosse in 1856. It appeared as a very faint, slightly elongated glow, 15"x12", with a low surface brightness.</p>
