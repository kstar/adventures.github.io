        <p>On the first night (October 3, 2013) of the Calstar gathering at Lake 
          San Antonio (<a href="http://lakesanantonioresort.com/">http://lakesanantonioresort.com/</a>), 
          I decided to work mainly on KTS triplets. This catalogue contains 76 
          isolated triplets, all south of -3 degrees declination, that was compiled 
          in 2000 by Russian astronomers V.E. Karachentseva and I.D. Karachentsev. 
          The objects were selected using ESO/SERC and POSS-I sky survey plates. 
          Roughly half of these triplets (designated KTS 1, KTS 2, etc.) are accessible 
          from sites in northern or central California, while the other half requires 
          a trip further south (preferably the southern hemisphere!). The first 
          object I looked at, though, is Hickson Compact Group (HCG) 99, which 
          is located much further north in Pegasus. The images are either from 
          the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) or the DSS from WikiSky. All observing 
          notes were made with my 24-inch f/3.7 Starstructure, generally at 375x 
          unless noted otherwise.</p>

        <p>HCG 99B = UGC 12899 is the brightest of 5 members in HCG 99. At 375x 
          it appeared moderately bright, fairly small, round, 30&quot; diameter, 
          increases evenly to a brighter quasi-stellar nucleus. HCG 99C = CGCG 
          499-33 is attached at the west end [40&quot; between centers] and was 
          easily seen as a faint to fairly faint glow, elongated 5:2 E-W, 30&quot;x12&quot;, 
          with a slightly brighter nucleus. HCG 99A = UGC 12897 has a mag 11.5 
          star attached at the south end which detracts from viewing, but this 
          is the largest member of the quintet. It appeared fairly faint, fairly 
          small, very elongated 3:1 N-S, ~40&quot;x13&quot;. The two faintest 
          members, HCG 99D and 99E, were both extremely faint and small, roundish. 
          99D was slightly larger at 10&quot; with 99E just a very dim 6&quot; 
          glow.</p>

          edge-on 5:1 nearly N-S, 1.5'x0.3', sharply concentrated with a small, 
          bright elongated core increasing to a stellar nucleus. NGC 172 was fairly 
          faint, moderately large, edge-on SSW-NNE, 0.9'x0.2', irregular surface 
          brightness. NGC 168 appeared fairly faint, moderately large, edge-on 
          5:1 SSW-NNE, 40&quot;x8&quot;, broad weak concentration. A mag 10.4

          S and appeared fairly faint, elongated 5:2 WNW-ESE, 45&quot;x22&quot;, 
          slightly brighter core. MCG -04-02-031 = KTS 5C at 4.6' NE of IC 1562

          17' diameter</p>
        <p>NGC 899 = KTS 16A is the brightest (or highest surface brightness) 
          in a triplet with IC 223 = KTS 16B 5' NNE and NGC 907 = KTS 16C 17' 
          NE. At 375x, NGC 899 appeared fairly bright, moderately large, irregular, 
          ~0.9'x0.7'. A very faint extension was repeatedly visible on the SE 
          end protruding towards the east. This asymmetry is confirmed on the 
          DSS, which reveals a chaotic system with knots. A wide pair of mag 13 
          stars is less than 2' SW. IC 233 appeared fairly faint to moderately 
          bright, fairly small, oval 3:2 NW-SE, broad concentration, 30&quot;x20&quot;. 
          Forms the vertex of a triangle with a mag 11.5 star 1.8' N and a mag 
          12.5 star 2.5' ENE. Finally, NGC 907 was moderately to fairly bright, 
          fairly large, very elongated 3:1 E-W, 1.5'x0.5'. Irregular surface brightness 
          and clearly brighter on the east side.</p>

        <p>This interacting pair consists of two faint galaxies separated by just

        <p>28 galaxies were observed in this group, which is part of the Pisces-Perseus 
          Supercluster. The field in the image is dominated by NGC 499 which appeared 
          fairly bright, moderately large, elongated 4:3 WSW-ENE, 60&quot;x45&quot;, 
          well concentrated with a very bright core. Nearby are NGC 498 1.8' N, 
          NGC 501 2.8' SE, NGC 498 3.4' WNW and NGC 496 4.2' N. Perhaps the faintest 
          NGC galaxy is 498, discovered with the 72-inch of Lord Rosse in 1856. 
          It appeared as a very faint, slightly elongated glow, 15&quot;x12&quot;, 
          with a low surface brightness.</p>
