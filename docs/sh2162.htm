  <p>17.5: the "Bubble Nebula" nebula extends mainly N [center 5.5' NE] of the involved illuminating mag 8.4 star <x-dso>SAO 20575</x-dso>. There are suspected dark lanes to the N with very faint nebulosity
  just N of this gap. The main piece curves away from the involved star towards the E but appears brightest at the W edge near the bright star. Only a portion of the rim of the "Bubble" was
  viewed. <x-dso>M52</x-dso> lies 35' NE.</p>
  <p>13: unusual appearance - surrounds a mag 8 star with a mag 7 star nearby to the SW. The nebulosity mostly appears N of the mag 8 star with a suspected dark lane to the N of this
  nebulosity. Very faint nebulosity appears close N of this lane. The main section hooks around the involved star to the E. - Steve Gottlieb</p>
