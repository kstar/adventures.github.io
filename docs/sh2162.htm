17.5: the "Bubble Nebula" nebula extends mainly N [center 5.5' NE] of the involved illuminating mag 8.4 star SAO 20575.  There are suspected dark lanes to the N with very faint nebulosity just N of this gap.  The main piece curves away from the involved star towards the E but appears
brightest at the W edge near the bright star.  Only a portion of the rim of the "Bubble" was viewed.  M52 lies 35' NE.<p>

13: unusual appearance - surrounds a mag 8 star with a mag 7 star nearby to the SW. The nebulosity mostly appears N of the mag 8 star with a suspected dark lane to the N of this nebulosity. Very faint nebulosity appears close N of this lane. The main section hooks around the involved
star to the E. - Steve Gottlieb<p>
