                component of a remarkable interacting system with the multi-component 
                ring galaxy NGC 2445. At 488x it appeared bright, small, slightly 
                elongated, 30&quot; diameter, sharply concentrated with a very 
                high surface brightness nucleus ~12&quot;-15&quot; diameter. NGC 
                2445, directly southeast has 6 components: a bright ring nucleus 
                and five very small HII regions which are roughly equally spaced 
                around the nucleus (separations between 25&quot; and 42&quot;). 
                The four closest (VV 117b, 117e, 117f, 117g) form a very small 
                square with the nucleus at the center! The nucleus appears moderately 
                bright to fairly bright, small, round, high surface brightness, 
                15&quot; diameter. The five HII regions are within an irregular, 
                triangular glow, ~1.5' diameter.<br>
                <br>
                VV 117b is at the northern end of NGC 2445, just 27&quot; N of 
                the nucleus and 36&quot; SSE of NGC 2444. It appeared very faint, 
                very small, round, 8&quot; diameter. VV 117f is situated 25&quot; 
                W of the nucleus and appeared very faint to faint, very small, 
                round, 10&quot; diameter. VV 117h is at the SW corner (42&quot; 
                SW of the nucleus) and was the faintest of the 5 knots surrounding 
                the nucleus. It appeared extremely faint and small, round, just 
                5&quot; diameter. VV 117e is at the east end (35&quot; E of the 
                nucleus) and appeared very faint to faint, very small, irregularly 
                round, ~12&quot; diameter.<br>
                <br>
                Finally, VV 117g is at the southeast corner, 30&quot; S of the 
                nucleus, and appeared fairly faint, very small, round, high surface 
                brightness, 12&quot; diameter. This object was the brightest of 
                5 &quot;knots&quot; surrounding the nucleus, although on the SDSS 
                it appears to be an HII region attached to a foreground star, 
                which certainly contributed to its brightness. In the 2009 Madore 
                &quot;Atlas and Catalogue of Collisional Ring Galaxies&quot; VV 
                117g is identified as the second collider (C2).</td>

              A diffuse glow mainly northwest of the nucleus (about 0.4') contains 
              three brighter knots forming a ring. A short, very thin extension 
              to the west of the nucleus forms the brightest portion of the ring.

              lies 2.3' NW, just 27&quot; W of a mag 14.7 star. It appeared fairly 
              faint, fairly small, slightly elongated E-W, 20&quot;x15&quot;. 
              These three galaxies have a identical redshifts as Arp 55, so are 
              part of a small group.</td>

              <p>28) NGC 2798/2799 = Arp 282: NGC 2798 is very bright, large, 
                elongated 2:1 NNW-SSE, 2.0'x1.0'. Sharply concentrated with a 
                very bright, large core increasing to a small, intense nucleus. 
                A very large spiral arm extends to the NNW from the core and curves 
                back sharply at the end counterclockwise to the SSE, fading rapidly 
                to a very low surface brightness and dimmng out before reaching 
                the core. The SSE extension has an extremely low surface brightness 
                and no arm structure was visible. Forms an interacting pair with 
                NGC 2799 1.5' ESE. NGC 2799 was fairly bright, very thin edge-on, 
                6:1 NW-SE, 1.4'x0.25'. The disc is slightly warped, bending south 
                slightly near the tips of both extensions. The galaxy is also 
                asymmetric, with the NW end stretched out towards the core of 
                NGC 2798. With careful viewing, an extremely faint tidal tail 
                appears pulled out in the direction of the companion and it fades 
                out just east of the core.</p>

                ~2:1 SW-NE, sharply concentrated with a very bright core. The 
                visual treat was a prominent lens or eye-shaped ring surrounding 
                the core! The ring was slightly brighter in an arc along the north 
                side. At the west edge of this arc was a very faint quasi-stellar 
                knot (SDSS J112141.34+201039.0, V = 17.2). Another section of 
                the ring that stands out is along the southwest edge, with a brighter 
                linear piece about 40&quot; long that has several SDSS designations. 
                The interior of the ring is fairly dark near this section, as 
                well as other sections, providing a good contrast with the core 
                and ring. A very small, weak brightening was also noted on the 
                NE end of the ring. A mag 14 star lies 1.4' NW of center and a 
                mag 16 star is 1' SSE of center.</p>
