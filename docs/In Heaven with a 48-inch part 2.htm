                appeared bright, small, slightly elongated, 30" diameter, sharply concentrated with a very high surface brightness nucleus ~12"-15" diameter. NGC 2445, directly southeast has

                117b, 117e, 117f, 117g) form a very small square with the nucleus at the center! The nucleus appears moderately bright to fairly bright, small, round, high surface brightness,

                brightest of 5 "knots" surrounding the nucleus, although on the SDSS it appears to be an HII region attached to a foreground star, which certainly contributed to its
                brightness. In the 2009 Madore "Atlas and Catalogue of Collisional Ring Galaxies" VV 117g is identified as the second collider (C2).</td>
