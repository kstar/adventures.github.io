title: Philosophy of Adventures in Deep Space

In a day of social media and forums like <a href="https://www.cloudynights.com/">CloudyNights</a> and <a href="https://www.deepskyforum.com/">DeepSkyForum</a>, and with AI-generated content, one asks what good is an old-fashioned static website with hand-written articles!

I believe that the website still provides something profoundly useful – organized observing lists and curated reports of observing experiences in long-form. Forums are designed for discussion, but these static webpages are designed to stay and be found, so you can come back and refer to these observing programs over and over.

We are looking for contributions. Any contributions you make should fit the style and themes of Adventures in Deep Space – keep them to visual deep-sky observing (night vision is fine) and related content, with an emphasis on advanced targets not discussed elsewhere. You may contact us at the e-mail address listed on the homepage with your suggestions for contributions.
