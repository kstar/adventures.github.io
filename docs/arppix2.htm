Located 2.2' ENE of mag 8.4 SAO 1148 which interferes with viewing.  Three mag 11 stars also in line with the 8.4 star to the S including a mag 11.5 star just 1.4' SW.  Forms a pair with N2300 6.4' ESE.<br> 8: faint, moderately large, low surface brightness, slightly elongated.  A mag 9 star is near.<p> N2300 = U03798 = M+14-04-031 = Arp 114<br> 13: fairly bright, bright core, small fainter halo.  Forms a pair with N2276 7' W.  IC 455 is 11' SSE.<br> 8: moderately bright, small, bright core, slightly elongated.<p><hr><p>   <a name="arp135"></a> <center><H3>ARP 135 (NGC 1023)<br> Elliptical Galaxy with Nearby Fragments in Perseus</H3> <IMG SRC="images/arp135.jpg" WIDTH=50%><p></center> N1023 = U02154 = M+06-06-073 = Z523-083<br> 17.5: bright, large, very elongated 7:2 ~E-W, very bright core, almost stellar nucleus.  Large fainter halo increases size to 7'x2'.  Two 15th magnitude stars are superimposed on the W and E ends.<br> 13: very bright, impressive, elongated ~E-W, bright core, stellar nucleus.<br> 8: fairly bright, bulging bright core, lens-shape.<p><hr><p>  <a name="arp157"></a> <center><H3>ARP 157 (NGC 520)<br> Disturbed Galaxy with Interior Absorption in Pisces</H3> <IMG SRC="images/arp157.jpg" WIDTH=50%><p></center> N0520 = U00966 = M+01-04-052 = Arp 157 = VV 231<br> 17.5: fairly bright, moderately large, elongated 5:2 NW-SE, 3.0'x1.2'. Very unusual appearance; the NW portion is noticeably brighter with a bright knot at the NW tip and a mottled texture.  Fades towards the SE where it merges into a fainter section which is tilted ~E-W with an irregular surface brightness and ill-defined edges.<br> 8: faint, diffuse, elongated N-S.<p><hr><p>  <a name="arp199"></a> <center><H3>ARP 199 (NGC 5544/45)<br> <i>The X-Rated Galaxy</i><br> Galaxy with Material Ejected from Nucleus in Bootes</H3> <IMG SRC="images/arp199.jpg"><p></center> N5544 = U09142 = M+06-31-090 = Z191-073w = Arp 199 = VV 21014 <br> 17.5: very elongated streak WSW-ENE, moderately large, uneven surface brightness.  This is a contact pair appearing as two brighter knots at the SW end (actually N5544) and the NE end (N5545).<p> N5545 = U09143 = M+06-31-091 = Z191-073e = Arp 199 = VV 21014<br>  17.5: double system elongated WSW-ENE and attached to N5544 at the WSW end, 0.6' between centers.  Appears larger than N5544.  The two systems are separated by just a small darker region of lower surface brightness but are not cleanly resolved.<p><hr><p>  <a name="arp217"></a> <center><H3>ARP 217 (NGC 3310)<br> <i>The Bow & Arrow</i><br> Galaxy with Adjacent Loops in Ursa Major</H3> <IMG SRC="images/arp217.jpg" WIDTH=50%><p></center> N3310 = U05786 = M+09-18-008 = Arp 217<br> 17.5: very bright, moderately large.  Unusual appearance as contains a very bright, very large central core with uniform high surface brightness with only a very faint fairly small halo elongated NW-SE.  Mag 5.5 HR 4165 lies 10.4' NNE at the edge of the 220x field and a mag 12 star is 3.0' N.<p><hr><p>   <a name="arp242"></a> <center><H3>ARP 242 (NGC 4676/76B)<br> <i>The Mice</i><br> Galaxy with Appearance of Fission in Coma Berenices</H3> <IMG SRC="images/arp242.jpg" WIDTH=50%><p></center> N4676 = U07938 = M+05-30-076 = Z159-072w = VV 224 = Arp 242 = IC 819 = The Mice = (R)N4676A<br> 17.5: this is the NW member of the interacting pair dubbed "The Mice". Faint, small, low surface brightness, elongated ~N-S.  In contact with N4676B = IC 820 at the SE end.  The thin "tails" visible on photos not seen.<p>  N4676B = U07939 = M+05-30-077 = Z159-072e = IC 820 = The Mice<br> 17.5: this is the SE member of the interacting pair dubbed the "Mice". This object is the brighter of the pair and appears faint, small, round with a small bright core.  In contact with N4676A at the NW edge.<p><hr><p>  <a name="arp263"></a> <center><H3>ARP 263 (NGC 3239)<br> Galaxy with Irregular Clumps in Leo</H3> <IMG SRC="images/arp263.jpg" WIDTH=50%><p></center> N3239 = U05637 = M+03-27-025 = Arp 263<br> 17.5: fairly faint, moderately large, elongated 2:1 E-W, very unusual appearance as a mag 9 star (BD+17 2217) is superimposed on the S side.  An unusually bright knot is following the bright star by 51" on the SE side of the galaxy. This is possibly an offset nucleus or a close double star.  The galaxy appears to extend to the W from this knot.  Exhibits an irregular surface brightness with edges difficult to define as fades into the background.  The halo is more extensive to the N with averted vision. About 2' NE and 2' W are two mag 11 and 12 stars.  <P> <center><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="images/Home.jpg"></A></center> <!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->
