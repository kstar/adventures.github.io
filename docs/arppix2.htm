  </center>N2276 = U03740 = M+14-04-028 = Arp 114 = 7Z 134<br>
  13: diffuse, slightly elongated. Located 2.2' ENE of mag 8.4 <x-dso>SAO 1148</x-dso> which interferes with viewing. Three mag 11 stars also in line with the 8.4 star to the S including a mag 11.5 star
  just 1.4' SW. Forms a pair with N2300 6.4' ESE.<br>
  8: faint, moderately large, low surface brightness, slightly elongated. A mag 9 star is near.
  <p>N2300 = U03798 = M+14-04-031 = Arp 114<br>
  13: fairly bright, bright core, small fainter halo. Forms a pair with N2276 7' W. <x-dso>IC 455</x-dso> is 11' SSE.<br>
  8: moderately bright, small, bright core, slightly elongated.</p>

  17.5: bright, large, very elongated 7:2 ~E-W, very bright core, almost stellar nucleus. Large fainter halo increases size to 7'x2'. Two 15th magnitude stars are superimposed on the W and E
  ends.<br>
  13: very bright, impressive, elongated ~E-W, bright core, stellar nucleus.<br>
  8: fairly bright, bulging bright core, lens-shape.

  </center>N0520 = U00966 = M+01-04-052 = Arp 157 = VV 231<br>
  17.5: fairly bright, moderately large, elongated 5:2 NW-SE, 3.0'x1.2'. Very unusual appearance; the NW portion is noticeably brighter with a bright knot at the NW tip and a mottled texture.
  Fades towards the SE where it merges into a fainter section which is tilted ~E-W with an irregular surface brightness and ill-defined edges.<br>
  8: faint, diffuse, elongated N-S.

  17.5: very elongated streak WSW-ENE, moderately large, uneven surface brightness. This is a contact pair appearing as two brighter knots at the SW end (actually N5544) and the NE end
  (N5545).
  <p>N5545 = U09143 = M+06-31-091 = Z191-073e = Arp 199 = VV 21014<br>
  17.5: double system elongated WSW-ENE and attached to N5544 at the WSW end, 0.6' between centers. Appears larger than N5544. The two systems are separated by just a small darker region of
  lower surface brightness but are not cleanly resolved.</p>

  17.5: very bright, moderately large. Unusual appearance as contains a very bright, very large central core with uniform high surface brightness with only a very faint fairly small halo
  elongated NW-SE. Mag 5.5 HR 4165 lies 10.4' NNE at the edge of the 220x field and a mag 12 star is 3.0' N.

  17.5: this is the NW member of the interacting pair dubbed "The Mice". Faint, small, low surface brightness, elongated ~N-S. In contact with N4676B = IC 820 at the SE end. The thin "tails"
  visible on photos not seen.
  <p>N4676B = U07939 = M+05-30-077 = Z159-072e = IC 820 = The Mice<br>
  17.5: this is the SE member of the interacting pair dubbed the "Mice". This object is the brighter of the pair and appears faint, small, round with a small bright core. In contact with
  N4676A at the NW edge.</p>

  </center>N3239 = U05637 = M+03-27-025 = Arp 263<br>
  17.5: fairly faint, moderately large, elongated 2:1 E-W, very unusual appearance as a mag 9 star (BD+17 2217) is superimposed on the S side. An unusually bright knot is following the bright
  star by 51" on the SE side of the galaxy. This is possibly an offset nucleus or a close double star. The galaxy appears to extend to the W from this knot. Exhibits an irregular surface
  brightness with edges difficult to define as fades into the background. The halo is more extensive to the N with averted vision. About 2' NE and 2' W are two mag 11 and 12 stars.
