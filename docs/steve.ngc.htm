        <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp; 
        <p> <font size="3">Here are my observing notes for every non-stellar object 
          in the entire NGC, which was compiled by John Louis Dreyer in 1888. 
          This famous catalogue includes 7840 entries discovered visually up to 
          that date, the majority from William Herschel and his son John. As far 
          as I know, these notes are the only visual journal of the entire NGC 
          by a single observer, covering the entire sky from north to south celestial 
          pole. In addition, I've included visual notes on 2362 objects from the 
          IC (Index Catalogues of 1894 and 1907) for a total of 10,202 NGC/IC 
          designations. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3"> In 2014, I completed a 35-year project of observing 
          every NGC object north of -41 degrees declination. These were all the 
          NGCs accessible from my home in northern California. At that time I 
          had also covered most of the far southern sky from several previous 
          trips to Australia, with 300 NGCs remaining that were not visible from 
          the United States. After a few additional observing trips to the southern 
          hemisphere, I completed the last remaining 34 NGCs during the November 
          2017 <a href="https://ozsky.org">OzSky Star Safari</a>, which took place 
          on the Markdale Homestead, a large working sheep ranch and country estate 
          3 &frac12; hour drive west of Sydney. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3"> Since that date I've been trying to complete the 1529 
          entries in the first Index Catalogue (IC I).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>The vast majority of these are faint galaxies, with over half 
          the total from Stephane Javelle, who observed with a 30-inch f/23 refractor 
          at the Nice observatory in France. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I 
          now have just 119 of these galaxies remaining to observe. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3"> All my observations and notes were made at fairly dark 
          observing sites used by clubs and individuals in the San Francisco bay 
          area as well as various northern California star parties at Lassen National 
          Park and northeastern California. In addition, a large number of summer 
          observations were made at high elevation sites in the Sierras or the 
          White Mountains east of Bishop. Generally, these observations were made 
          with SQM readings from 21.3-21.9. Deep southern objects were observed 
          on 8 weeklong observing trips to Australia using 14&quot; to 30&quot; 
          scopes that were provided by Zane Hammond at his &quot;Magellan Observatory&quot; 
          and at several OzSky Star Safaris. Some southern observations were also 
          made using Ray Cash's 13&quot; travel scope that I brought to Costa 
          Rica and with C-8 from the southern end of Baja. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3"> I began taking notes on the Messier objects using a 
          6&quot; f/5 reflector in 1978. Three years later I started exploring 
          fainter NGCs with a 13.1&quot; Odyssey I. The vast majority of my notes, 
          though, were made with a 17.5&quot; f/4.5 homemade dob (1987-2002) and 
          an 18&quot; f/4.3 Starmaster (2003-2011). Since 2012 I've used a 24&quot; 
          f/3.7 Starstructure. I've also taken detailed notes on over 500 NGC 
          and IC objects using Jimi Lowrey's 48&quot; gigantic dobsonian from 
          west Texas. In general, you'll find multiple observations of many NGCs, 
          so their visual appearances can be compared through a variety of apertures. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="3"> All of the NGC/IC identifications have been checked 
          for historical accuracy as part of <a href="http://ngcicproject.observers.org">NGC/IC 
          Project</a> (database no longer available but see <a href="http://ngcicproject.observers.org/NGC/">here</a>). 
          At the end of my visual observations of each NGC, I've included historical 
          discovery information such as the observer's name, date, telescope, 
          and the original discovery descriptions. Modern catalogues discrepancies 
          and errors are also discussed. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3"> In addition to the NGC and IC, the final link includes 
          observations of nearly 1200 galaxies in the Uppsala General Catalogue 
          (UGC), which are not in the NGC or IC. These are generally fainter galaxies 
          that are at least 10' diameter on the first National Geographic-Palomar 
          Observatory Sky Survey (POSS). </font></p>
        <p><font size="3"> I want to acknowledge the investigative work of Dr. 
          Harold Corwin and Dr. Wolfgang Steinicke, who I've communicated with 
          for many years on a number of identification problems. Harold Corwin 
          provides precise positions and extensive historical notes on thousands 
          of NGC and IC objects at <a
href="http://haroldcorwin.net/ngcic/">http://haroldcorwin.net/ngcic/</a>. Wolfgang 
          Steinicke provides biographical information on 172 NGC/IC astronomers, 
          as well as a number of historically accurate catalogues in .xls format 
          on his web site at <a href="http://www.klima-luft.de/steinicke/index_e.htm">http://www.klima-luft.de/steinicke/index_e.htm</a>. 
          For those interesting in learning more on the history of the NGC, I 
          highly recommend Wolfgang's book &quot;Observing and Cataloguing Nebulae 
          and Star Clusters&quot;. </font></p>
