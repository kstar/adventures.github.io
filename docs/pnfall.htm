    <h1>Autumn Planetaries</h1>
  </center>- by Doug Snyder
  <p>These observations were made most recently using a 20" f/5 scope under relatively dark skies (limiting magnitude usually about 6.5), but many of the objects can be viewed with smaller
  instruments with good optics. Observing note applicable for anyone trying these objects (and for observing in general): Use a black shroud or towel to cover your head and the eyepiece while
  you are viewing. This prevents stray light from entering into your eyepiece, causing reflections and significantly reducing the contrast!</p>

      <td width="450">Located within a moderately crowded star field, this planetary is fairly easy to locate using direct vision without the initial use of a filter. At first glance, it may
      appear small and circular, but definitely non-stellar. It has a surface brightness of around 12.8 magnitudes/sq. arcminute, and appears slightly oval at lower powers. At higher power
      and with the use of either an O-III (preferred) or UHC filter, the PN's visibility is enhanced and the extended shape becomes more obvious, with just a hint of darkening towards the
      center. The central star is not visible. Detecting the faint outer lobes is a real feat. High power; dark and transparent skies and very good seeing are absolutely necessary. There is a
      mag. 5.9 star (SAO 34256) about 16' SSE of the PN and another fainter, and smaller PN (M2-52) 36' to the east.</td>

      <td width="450">A pretty difficult object to locate in a field made up of many faint and scattered stars. Once the field is identified, use of an O-III filter from the get-go is
      necessary. Depending on the conditions, it might be barely visible with direct vision, but more likely you'll have to use averted vision. Its surface brightness (15.0) is almost
      identical with its magnitude. It will appear as a small disc, smaller than its catalog size listed above, and the central star will not be visible, although it is 'straddled' by two
      stars around mag. 13. Lower powers (100x to 150x) seem to work well, but the PN does not take well to high power. The biggest challenge I found was in identifying the field!</td>

      arcminute, but it is still quite visible with direct vision and without any filters. At low power and using an O-III filter, this annularly shaped ancient showpiece puts on quite a
      display. Along with many variations in brightness both in the interior and along the rim, the mag. 13.4 central star is quite distinctive, as are many field stars that lie superimposed
      along the annulus. Switching to a higher power, say around 200X - 300X, it is quite a trip to follow the east and west extensions out to where they blend into the background as there
      are many faint filaments in these regions of the Helix.</td>

      of the PN disc in the north - south direction, as the outer lobes (which would make it appear more circular) are extremely faint and visually overwhelmed by the main shell. There is a
      mag. 15.0 central star, but its visibility is questionable.</td>

      location of the PN, but is slightly distracting. The planetary will appear as a disc of about 30", and I believe that any evidence of the ring structure will be visible only with high
      power and on nights of excellent transparency. The PN takes high power well with a filter, with the UHC filter coming out on top as the filter of choice. With a surface brightness of
      12.6, it is easier than the visual mag. of 14.4 would suggest. The mag. 18.6 central star is not visible.</td>

      <td width="450">Exhibiting a pleasing bluish-green glow, this small and bright planetary will surprise many observers who go beyond admiring its color and study its appearance more
      closely. At high powers, which this PN takes well, one can begin to see more of the small ring structure and the brightness variations between the central core and the innermost shell.
      By combining an O-III filter and high power, these effects are more pronounced, and even without a filter, a second faint shell can be ascertained that also shows subtle structure and
      continued evidence of its softly glowing excitation. The central star, at mag. 12.7, is difficult due to the overall brightness of the PN, and can be glimpsed best at high power and
      without a filter.</td>

      arcs is very dark, showing no hint of nebulosity. The region on the western side of the nebula which connects the two arcs is significantly fainter, but still visible using averted
      vision. The use of an O-III filter is usually required, but there are nights when portions of the arcs can be glimpsed without a filter when the exact field location is known!</td>

      <td width="450">The many stars in the field make it difficult to pinpoint the exact location of this planetary, but perseverance and the O-III filter finally paved the way. This PN,
      being moderately large, and typically a faint Abell object, does not take high power well. I used about 100X to study the field without a filter, then progressed to 149X and the O-III
      to find Abell 84. With a surface brightness of 14.67, it is not terribly difficult, but the brightness variations around and in the oval-shaped object tend to make it appear more
      irregularly-shaped and without much structure. On most occasions, it is viewable with direct vision, but averted vision allows more of the annular shape to be seen. The brightest
      portion is a segment, not quite arc-shaped, on the east side, where there is also a mag. 10.7 star. As an aid in locating the field, there is a mag. 7.9 star (SAO 35757) about 13' SSW
      of the planetary.</td>

        An ancient, huge, and faint planetary that was discovered on the original POSS plates in 1986, this is one tough observation! Its age is estimated at around 40,000 years (very old and
        decrepit) and its distance at roughly 847 light years. Lying in a relatively quiet neighborhood of Cepheus, the planetary is nicely framed by a trio of bright stars which fall within
        a one degree circle. These three stars are of magnitudes 7.1, 7.7 and 8.0, and form an almost perfect equilateral triangle, with the PN nearly centered within this triangle. The best
        method of attack is to use very low power (80X to 100X), an O-III filter, and a dark shroud to cover the head and the eyepiece. Any external light or reflections entering the eyepiece
        will most likely render an attempt fruitless.
        <p>Although the PN is oval-shaped and elongated in a NW - SE direction, the region that is first glimpsed through the eyepiece is an arc of ejected material that lies on the NE
        portion of the shell. During moments of excellent seeing and transparency, the fainter portion of the arc to the north may also be detected. In the field image here, the brightest
        star in the field is mag. 9.5 and lies at the NW edge of the nebula.This is the first known visual sighting of this planetary. (IsWe1 in Perseus at 03h 49.1m, +50d 00m remains
        undetected visually.)</p>
