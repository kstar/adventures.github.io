          <p>I observed twice at Lake Sonoma this new moon window, though I&#146;m 
            combining these into a single report featuring Fritz Zwicky. On Tuesday 
            June 16th, I observed with Dan Smiley and Ray Cash at our regular 
            Lone Rock lot along Rockpile Road. The transparency was good but the 
            seeing poor and we had occasional gusts all night. As a result I had 
            to limit magnifications to 260x, instead of 375x-450x that I often 
            use on small galaxies. And the various galaxies highlighted below 
            are all quite small.</p>
          <p>I returned again on Sunday, June 21th, to met Bob Douglas, Jim Molinari 
            and his friend Jeff. Our quartet had quite a bit of glass &#151; Bob 
            had his 28&#148; Starstructure, I was using my 24&#148; Starstructure, 
            Jim had a 22&#148; Obsession UC and Jeff an 18&#148; classic Obsession. 
            A few other amateurs pulled into the lot while it was getting dark 
            though I didn&#146;t go over to their scopes, so I don&#146;t know 
            their names. On the second night conditions were much better: warm 
            (no jacket/hat/gloves), completely calm, much better seeing (I cleanly 
            split the 0.6&#148; double star STF 2244 in Ophiuchus (mag 6.6/6.9) 
            and good transparency (faintest galaxy observed ~16.5).</p>
          <p>On both nights I focused on observing compact galaxies catalogued 
            by the brilliant, but combative astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky. His remarkable 
            paper in 1933 titled &#147;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.01693.pdf">The 
            Redshift of Extragalactic Nebulae</a>&#148; provided the first evidence 
            of dark matter (called &#147;dunkle Materie&#148;). His conclusion 
            was based on the velocities of 7 galaxies in the Coma Galaxy Cluster, 
            which he used to estimate the mass of the cluster using the &#147;virial 
            theorem&quot;. His calculations showed the mass was 400x greater than 
            expected from the luminous matter. He concluded &#147;dark matter 
            exists in much greater density than luminous matter.&#148; Of course, 
            his proposal of dark matter was ahead of his time and ignored as preposterous. 
            In 1937 he predicted the formation of images from gravitational lensing 
            of distant &quot;extragalactic nebulae&quot; by nearer galaxies along 
            the same line of sight. The first example was not discovered until 
            1979, five years after his death.</p>
          <p>He followed up with a<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/20/5/259"> 
            famous paper co-authored with William Baade in 1934</a>. Zwicky and 
            Baade proposed that &#147;supernova&#148; explosions &#147;represent 
            the transition of an ordinary star into a neutron star, consisting 
            mainly of neutrons&#148; (neutrons having been identified by James 
            Chadwick just two years earlier in 1932). Furthermore, Zwicky argued 
            that supernovae were the source of cosmic rays (a completely mysterious 
            phenomenon). It would take several decades before the first neutron 
            star would be confirmed as Zwicky and Baade predicted.</p>
          <p>Zwicky was famously cantankerous, referring to colleagues at Mount 
            Wilson as &#147;spherical bastards&#148; (bastards no matter which 
            side you looked at them). Several of the objects on my observing list 
            were from Zwicky's &#147;<a href="http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept02/Zwicky/frames.html">Catalogue 
            of Selected Compact Galaxies and of Post-Eruptive Galaxies</a>&#148; 
            (compiled in the 1960s) and have designations like VII Zw 591 (described 
            below). In the introduction to this self-published catalogue, Zwicky 
            went on a ballastic rant against several of his peers, accusing Alan 
            Sandage and William Baade of plagiarism, calling Henry Norris Russell 
            &#147;a shining example of a most deluded individual&#148;, and Edwin 
            Hubble of doctoring his observational data.</p>

        <p align="left">This striking galaxy was discovered by Anthony Wasilewski 
          in 1983 and reported in the paper &quot;The space density and spectroscopic 
          properties of a new sample of emission-line galaxies&#148;. He described 
          it as a &quot;Bright elongated patch with two knots. Eastern knot is 
          the emitter.&#148;</p>
        <p align="left">KUG 1138+327 (Kiso Ultaviolet Galaxy) is an excellent 
          example of a &#147;Tadpole Galaxy&#148;, a subclass of Blue Compact 
          Dwarfs (BCDs) with a giant star-forming region at the end of an elongated 
          tail with weak star formation. Vassar astronomer Debra Elmegreen has 
          studied these galaxies and noted that although tadpoles were relatively 
          common in the early Universe, &quot;they are rare in the local universe, 
          where only 0.2% of the 10,000 galaxies in the Kiso Survey of UV Bright 
          Galaxies are tadpoles.&#148; In a 2012 paper, she reported &quot;Tadpole 
          structure could have a variety of origins. Some tadpoles could be edge-on 
          disks with a single massive star-forming region at one end. Elmegreen 
          &amp; Elmegreen (2010) showed lopsided ring-like galaxies that would 
          look like tadpoles if viewed edge-on. Tadpoles could also result from 
          mergers like the famous case of UGC 10214, which is called the Tadpole 
          Galaxy. Another example is II Zw 40. However, Campos-Aguilar et al. 
          (1993) suggest that blue compact dwarf galaxies tend to be relatively 
          isolated, so the tadpole shapes among these may not generally be mergers.&#148;</p>
        <p align="left">She led a study in 2016 titled &quot;Hubble Space Telescope 
          Observations of Accretion-Induced Star Formation in the Tadpole Galaxy 
          Kiso 5639&#148;.<br>
          The study found &quot;The tadpole galaxy&#133;has a slowly rotating 
          disk with a drop in metallicity at its star-forming head, suggesting 
          that star formation was triggered by the accretion of metal-poor gas&#133;The 
          head has a mass in young stars of 1 million Solar masses.&#148; The 
          study suggested &quot;Motion through a reservoir of [primordial] H I 
          gas) could cause the accretion and promote star formation on the leading 
          edge of the dwarf, as might have happened for 30 Doradus in the Large 
          Magellanic Cloud&#148;. The spectacular HST image above is from this 
          study.</p>
        <p align="left">Visually through my 24&#148; at 375x, the galaxy was seen 
          as a faint, thin, low surface brightness streak oriented east-west and 
          about 20&#148;x6&#148; in size. The slightly brighter knot at the east 
          end was barely non-stellar). Backing down to 225x, the Tadpole&#146;s 
          &#147;head&quot; was obvious and more prominent than the main body extending 
          west. There seemed to be a slight contrast improvement when I added 
          a broadband DGM galaxy filter. A mag 12.2 star is just 45&quot; southwest 
          and a mag 10 star is 3.8&#146; west-southwest.</p>

        <p>Markarian 296 (KUG 1601+192) is another Blue Compact Dwarf (BCD) that 
          Elmegreen et al described as one of the two brightest &quot;Tadpole&#148; 
          galaxies in the 2012 paper &quot;Local Tadpole Galaxies&#148;. Instead 
          of single giant star-forming region, this tadpole has an irregular outline 
          and consists of two strings of blue knots. The study noted that &quot;[Mrk 
          296] has a massive head with many smaller clumps over a large region, 
          which at high redshift would appear as one or perhaps two large clumps.&#148;</p>
        <p>This tadpole lies in Western Hercules, just 1.5&deg; north of the Hercules 
          Galaxy Cluster (AGC 2151). But it lies in the foreground at a distance 
          of 210 million light years, half as far as the Hercules cluster. Using 
          225x and 260x, it appeared faint, very elongated 3:1 ~N-S, roughly 24&#148;x8&#148;. 
          The surface brightness was low and I was unable to detect any knots, 
          which must have a low contrast. A 12th magnitude star (at the edge of 
          this image) is 1.5' northeast.</p>

        <p>This Zwicky galaxy caught my attention as it appears to be another 
          Tadpole galaxy with a small blue head on the west end, though it wasn&#146;t 
          studied by Elmegreen. It was first catalogued by the Russian astronomer 
          Boris Vorontsov-Velyaminov, who noted it was possibly a triple system 
          (based on the POSS1 appearance). In 1968 it caught the attention of 
          Caltech astronomer Fritz Zwicky, who called it a &quot;Very blue sausage 
          shaped compact&#148;. The bright star on the right edge of this SDSS 
          image is 11th magnitude.</p>
        <p>VII Zw 591 (the 591st object in Zwicky&#146;s 7th list of compact galaxies) 
          is located 2.6&deg; northwest of 3.3-magnitude Iota Draconis. I found 
          a fairly faint, very thin edge-on WNW-ESE, ~45&#148; x 10&#148;. The 
          galaxy had an irregular surface brightness (patchy) and no core. I wasn&#146;t 
          able to clearly resolve any individual knots, just a mottled appearance.</p>

        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Most sources identify object as a pair of galaxies, but the deformed 
          eastern galaxy (VV 326a), which isbrightest along a sickle-shaped outline, 
          may be an interacting pair itself, with blue knot at the north end a 
          secondary nucleus. This eastern starburst galaxy was catalogued by Benjamin 
          Markarian as Mrk 455, due to its ultraviolet spectrum. The two main 
          objects have identical redshift (z = .034), implying a light-travel 
          time of 465 million years and they are found in Canes Venatici, 3.8&deg; 
          northwest of M3</p>
        <p>The pair (separated by 0.6&#146;) was easily resolved at 375x. VV 326b, 
          the western galaxy, appeared faint, slightly elongated, about 18&quot; 
          diameter. VV 326a, the eastern galaxy, appeared slightly brighter, elongated 
          5:2 ~N-S, ~25&#148; x 10&#148;. It contained a bright core or knot. 
          Interestingly, there&#146;s another unusual galaxy, VV 69 = UGC 8496, 
          just 5&#146; northwest. This appears to be a merging pair of blue dwarfs, 
          though it lies in the foreground of VV 326 at half the redshift. </p>

        <p>I Zw 115 is a nearby (~33 million light years, based on the Tully-Fischer 
          method) dwarf in eastern Bootes. Zwicky found it on the POSS1 and called 
          it a &#147;blue post-eruptive galaxy with several compact knots on central 
          disk.&#148; The SDSS shows an unusual rectangular shape with a brighter 
          central region contains several blue knots and two wings, like a strange 
          celestial moth. The galaxy&#146;s physical dimensions are roughly 11 
          million l.y. by 3.5 million l.y. </p>
        <p>At 260x, VV 720 was moderately faint, very elongated SW-NE ~0.6'x0.2', 
          no nucleus. The outer extensions had a very low surface brightness.

          3&deg; from the north celestial pole! In Zwicky&#146;s distinctive style 
          of describing disturbed galaxies, he called this a &quot;Post-eruptive 
          blue pair of disrupted spirals, with distorted arms, jets and several 
          red and blue faint compact knots in field&#148;. The red eastern galaxy 
          is an ultra-luminous infrared galaxy with the pair included in the 2004 
          study &quot;Optical Imaging of Very Luminous Infrared Galaxy Systems: 
          Photometric Properties and Late Evolution&#148;: &quot;Two galaxies 
          in interaction separated by 42&quot; (44 kpc). The largest is a face-on 
          spiral rotating clockwise. The northern arm connects with the smaller 
          galaxy. The other spiral arm extends toward the south where a patchy 
          structure (dwarf galaxy?) is clearly visible in the three filters.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Using a variety of magnifications (225x, 260x and 375x) 
          the brighter western galaxy (PGC 60075) was fairly faint, roughly oval 
          3:2 north-south, maybe 35&quot;x25&quot;, weak concentration but no 
          distinct core, irregular surface brightness. PGC 60093, just 45&#148; 
          east, was barely visible as an extremely faint and small glow, 10&quot; 
          diameter (probably the core). The duo lies at a distance of some 350 
          million l.y.</p>

          a &quot;Blue post-eruptive chain of compacts, (with) extended plumes.&#148; 
          UGC 11035 is a mid-to-advanced stage major merger (ultra-luminous in 
          the infrared) with two nuclei. The extended tidal plumes to the south 
          is evidence of the gravitational interaction, along with the unusual 
          distorted shape of the main body. A 2019 multi-wavelength investigation 
          including HST images showed the two nuclei have a separation of ~8500 
          parsecs. Huge regions display ongoing star-formation at a rate of ~10 
          to 30 Solar masses per year.</p>
        <p align="left">The galaxy appeared moderately faint and quite elongated 
          3:1 northwest-southeast, with a length of 1&#146;. The main body had 
          an unusual bowed or banana shape, concave outwards towards the west

        <p align="left">The Egg Nebula is the prototype of a pre-planetary nebula 
          (PPN); a star caught in the very brief stage between the Asymptotic 
          Giant Branch (AGB) and a Planetary Nebula (PN). The Egg Nebula has an 
          interesting discovery history. Surprisingly, Fritz Zwicky discovered 
          it on the POSS1 around 1966 and included it in his 4th list of compact 
          galaxies (the objects were selected solely on their photographic appearance). 
          He described IV Zw 67 as a &quot;pair of blue fuzzy oval compacts&#148;. 
          Because of Zwicky&#146;s error, it was included in the Uppsala Catalogue 
          of Galaxies as UGC 11668.</p>
        <p align="left">The Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories independently 
          discovered the Egg Nebula during a rocket-borne infrared sky survey 
          conducted in 1971-72 and it was catalogued it again as Cambridge Research 
          Lab (CRL) 2688. A follow-up investigation, using infrared, optical and 
          radio observations, revealed a dusty reflection nebula with a highly 
          polarized optical emission. Based on its roughly oval shape on the POSS1, 
          one of the original researchers (Mike Merrill) dubbed it the &#147;Egg 
          Nebula&#148;. A 2003 study detected NaCl in the circumstellar shell, 
          so a more accurate nickname is the &#147;Salty Egg Nebula&#148;.</p>
        <p align="left">In good seeing I observed the Egg Nebula at 375x, 500x 
          and finally 1000x, though even at 200x the two bipolar lobes were immediately 
          evident. This is a small object and could be easily passed over as an 
          out-of-focus double star. The two components combined are elongated 
          SSW-NNE and span roughly 24&#148; x 8&quot;. The NNE lobe is both brighter 
          and larger with a very high surface brightness. It appeared roughly 
          oval, ~10&#148; x 7&quot; SSW-NNE and rounded on its south end. At 1000x 
          a low surface brightness extension or &quot;fan&quot; was visible extending 
          further north. A dark gap separates the SSW component, which was fainter 
          and only ~5&quot; diameter</p>
        <p align="left">As roughly 50% of the light is polarized I brought along 
          a polarizing filter to test if I could see it visually dim or disappear 
          by rotating the filter in the proper orientation. I plopped the 1.25&quot; 
          filter directly on top of my 10mm and 6mm Zeiss Abbe Orthoscopic (ZAO) 
          eyepieces. Holding the rim of the filter, I slowly rotated it using 
          my thumb and index finger while peering through the filter. Sure enough, 
          the brightness dimmed significantly (perhaps 1-1.5 magnitudes). A 12th 
          magnitude star just 1.4' WNW was a convenient reference to gauge the 
          dimming as it was comparable in brightness to the brighter component 
          of the Egg. Although the fainter southern lobe never disappeared, at 
          minimum transmission it shrunk down to a nearly stellar point.</p>
