          <p>Friday night (July 25th), was the last of four consecutive clear nights at Lassen. And as a nice conclusion, we had our best conditions on this observing adventure. There was no
          wind or dew at the Bumpass Hell lot and transparency and seeing were both very good to excellent. Here's the set-up on Bumpass with Mark Wagner and another with the view towards the
          south. Interacting galaxies and compact galaxy groups were mostly the targets for the night, along with the unusual globular cluster Arp GC2, which may have been captured by the
          Milky Way from the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal galaxy.</p>

            <p align="left">VV 158 is chain of 4 CGCG galaxies with a total length of 5.5', and oriented WNW to ESE. Using 375x, <x-dso simbad="Z 162-031">CGCG 162-031</x-dso>, the westernmost galaxy, appeared fairly faint,
            fairly small, round, 20" diameter, contains a very small bright nucleus. A mag 14 star is 1.5' NW and a mag 15 star is 1.4' NE. <x-dso simbad="Z 162-032">CGCG 162-032</x-dso>, situated 1.5' ESE, appeared very
            faint to faint, round, 10" diameter. This is the faintest member in the chain and just south of the midpoint between CGCG 162-031 1.5' WNW and <x-dso simbad="Z 162-033">CGCG 162-033</x-dso> 1.5' E. CGCG 162-033,
            the third brightest in the chain, appeared faint, small, round, 15" diameter. <x-dso simbad="Z 162-034">CGCG 162-034</x-dso>, another 2.5' SW, appeared fairly faint, fairly small, elongated 2:1 NW-SE, 20"x10",

            <p align="left">VV 59 was picked up fairly easily at 260x as an faint elongated glow, but best view at 375x. The brighter component (<x-dso>VV 59a</x-dso>) is at the northeast end and appeared
            faint, small, irregularly round, 15" diameter. It appeared to taper at the northeast tip and brighten (triangular shape on the DSS).</p>
            <p align="left">An extremely faint glow extended 15" southwest, increasing the overall length to roughly 25". With careful viewing, a slightly brighter 6"-8" knot (core of <x-dso>VV 59b</x-dso>)
            would sometimes "pop" within this glow. The two interacting components of VV 59 were connected and not detached.</p>

            <p align="left">At 260x, this superthin galaxy appeared extremely faint, fairly small, edge-on 6:1 SW-NE, 0.6'x0.1', very low even surface brightness. A mag 14.5 star is at the
            northeast end. Although images show the galaxy extends northeast of the star, it appeared as a ghostly splinter extending southwest of the star. Located 2.3' SE of a mag 10/12.5
            pair at 25". Member of the <x-dso>NGC 5846</x-dso> Group.</p>

            <p align="left">Very faint, moderately large, low surface brightness glow, roughly 2' diameter. Contains a small, slightly brighter core or knot near the center. Slightly grainy
            or mottled appearance, but no clear resolution except around the edges (possibly field stars). Located 5' SW of a distinctive asterism consisting of a 1.5' east-west chain of four
            stars, with a fifth star 0.4' south of the center of the chain. Located 2.5Â° WNW of <x-dso>M55</x-dso>.</p>
            <p align="left">In 1965 (Galactic Structure, University of Chicago Press, page 401), Arp noted a new "...sparse globular cluster a plate of which was formed in Baade's file..."
            and reported it as Anonymous. Arp GC 2, along with Terzan 7, Terzan 8 and others lie very close to the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal galaxy (discovered in 1994) and appear to be
            former members of that galaxy.</p>

            elongated 3:2 SW-NE, roughly 27"x18" with a very small bright core. A mag 15.2 star is off the southwest end, 0.5' from center. <x-dso>HCG 82B</x-dso> lies 1.1' WNW, and appeared fairly faint,
            round, 20" diameter, very weak concentration. A mag 14.8 star is off the west side, 0.4' from center. <x-dso>HCG 86D</x-dso>, just 1.6' WNW, was faint (though easily visible), small, elongated
            2:1 NNW-SSE, ~15"x8". Finally <x-dso>HCG 86C</x-dso> was easily seen as a faint, small, irregularly round glow, ~18x15".</p>

            <p align="left">Striking example of a barred spiral with a prominent 1.5'x0.5' central bar oriented directly east-west. The bar contains a bright 30" core, which increases to a
            quasi-stellar nucleus. A bright arm is attached at the east end of the bar and extends due north for 0.7', at a right angle to the bar. A bright, elongated N-S "knot" is embedded
            in the middle (superimposed companion <x-dso>NGC 6908</x-dso>). At the north end, the arm curls west a short distance while dimming out. A difficult, ill-defined arm is attached at the west end
            of the bar. It vaguely curves south and west, but quickly disappears into very low surface brightness haze.</p>

            0.7' NW and a mag 12 star is 2.5' NE, collinear with the major axis. <x-dso>HCG 87B</x-dso> is just 1' SW and <x-dso>HCG 87C</x-dso> is 1.3' NW. The former galaxy is faint, round, ~18" diameter, compact with a
            high surface brightness, while HCG 87C is very faint, elongated 3:2 E-W, 15"x10". Low even surface brightness with no core. <x-dso>HCG 87D</x-dso> is a toughie (mag 17.6B) and I only managed a
            marginal sighting at 375x with one good "pop" in the correct location. <x-dso>ESO 597-034</x-dso> lies 7' southwest of the quartet and appeared faint, small, round, 20-25" diameter. .</p>

            distance to the northwest. The view was improved at 385x with a strong hint of a second spiral arm beginning at the south end of the bar and starting to bend east. Contains a
            bright, sharp stellar nucleus. A mag 10 star is 3' SE and a mag 12 star is at the southwest edge.</p>
