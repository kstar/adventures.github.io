    <h1>Virgo Highlights</h1><i>...A celestial wonderland of innumerable star cities, twinkling across the millions of light years.</i>--Robert Burnham
  </center>This part of the sky used to be called <i>the Realm of the Nebulae</i> because of the high concentration of deep sky objects here. Back in those days, not so long ago, astronomers
  had not yet realized that some faint fuzzies were clouds of gas within our own galaxy, and others were gigantic collections of stars, gas and dust similar to the Milky Way itself.
  <p>It's easy to get lost in the Virgo Cluster. Finding and identifying the many Messier objects here is a good exercise in keeping your bearings at the eyepiece. After logging the galaxies
  that Messier found, and tracing out <a href="virgo.htm">Markarian's Chain,</a> what next? Check out some of these galaxy pairs that are among my favorite objects in the Virgo Cluster. (The
  observing notes are by Steve Gottlieb.)</p>

          </center>This is one of the most prominent links in Markarian's Chain, lying just 20 arcminutes east of <x-dso>M86</x-dso>. A famous observer from the last century, L.S. Copeland, gave this
          interacting pair its nickname. Actually, there is some question whether <x-dso>NGC 4438</x-dso> is really interacting with NGC 4435. According to Brian Skiff, <i>NGC 4438 is probably a
          mostly-merged pair of galaxies, but 4435 is utterly undisturbed, and I'm quite willing to bet the next round of beers that it has nothing to do with 4438.</i>

          12 27.7 +13 05<br>
          17.5: bright, fairly small, oval SSW-NNE, bright core, stellar nucleus. Forms a striking pair called the "Eyes" with slightly fainter N4438 4.5' SSE. Located 20' E of M86 in the
          central core of the Virgo cluster.</p>

          12 27.8 +13 01<br>
          17.5: bright, elongated 5:2 SSW-NNE, small bright core. Forms a striking pair with N4435 4.5' NNW. The core is not as large or bright as N4435. Located in the center of the Virgo
          cluster 23' E of M86.</p>

          </center>Look two degrees southeast of <x-dso>M87</x-dso> to find this fascinating pair of interacting galaxies joined at the eastern end. (I love these wonderful old nicknames from the nineteenth
          century, don't you?) In fact, the Siamese Twins may not be interacting at all. According to a recent article from the professional journals, <i>There are numerous H-Alpha regions
          spread out across the surfaces of both NGC 4567 and <x-dso>NGC 4568</x-dso>. However, the general lack of tidal tails, x-ray emission, or discernible tidal signatures in the nuclear regions all
          argue that the galaxies are not interacting.</i>

          17.5: this is the southern member of a double system with N4567. The NE end of this galaxy is nearly attached to the E end of N4567. Moderately bright and large, elongated 5:2
          SSW-NNE, large brighter core. Two mag 11/12 stars lie 3.5' E.</p>

          center of a group of six faint mag 14 stars. A brighter mag 11 star lies 3.1' SW of center. Forms a pretty pair with N4762 11' SE.</p>

          17.5: very bright, fairly large, beautiful edge-on 12:1 SW-NE, 6.0'x0.5', small intensely bright core, stellar nucleus. The unusually thin arms taper at the ends. The galaxy appears
          to have a sharper light cut-off possibly due to a dust lane along the W side. Located almost midway between two 9th magnitude stars (<x-dso>SAO 100313</x-dso> 3.9' WSW and a mag 9.5 star 2.8' E).
          Forms a pair with N4754 11' NW.</p>
