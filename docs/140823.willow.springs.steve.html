      <td height="56">On August 23 2014, I met Mark Wagner and Mark Johnston at 
        Bob Ayers' Willow Springs property, roughly 30 miles southeast of Hollister 
        and perhaps 20 miles northwest of Pinnacles National Park. Here's the 
        view from this 3000 ft site, looking south over the rolling hills of rural 
        San Benito county with my scope in the foreground (24-inch f/3.7 Starstructure) 
        along with Mark Johnston's 18&quot; f/3.7 Starmaster. Wagner and I had 
        some equipment issues during set-up -- Mark discovered he forgot a battery 
        as well as his finder and I had electrical issue causing a short in my 
        Servocat system. Fortunately, with some help from Mark Johnston the issues 
        were resolved before it was fully dark.
        <p>Observing conditions were good with no wind, clouds or moisture though 
          the transparency was on the low end of typical SQM readings (21.4-21.6) 
          at this site (situated in a dark blue light pollution zone). I observed 
          until 3:00 and then crashed out in my minivan. All in all, a very relaxing, 
          productive evening! The following Wednesday I was off again to observe 
          at Lake Sonoma - more on that adventure in my next report. </p>

            NGC 6642<br>
            18 31 54.2 -23 28 34<br>
            Size: 4.5'; Mag: V = 9.4</p>
          <p align="left">This fairly bright gc contains a very bright core and 
            an irregular 2' halo. At 375x, stars stream out to the east and west 
            creating an impression of elongation. The core is very lively and 
            a few brighter stars are clearly resolved, though packed together 
            very tightly. Roughly 20 stars are resolved in the halo. At 500x, 
            30-35 stars are resolved (many popping in/out of view) including 8-10 
            in a clump at the center and close to the core. A single brighter 
            star is just south of the core and a nice pair (~3&quot; separation) 
            is in the halo on the NNE side. A string of stars extends out of the 
            cluster to the north. Easily visible in the 80mm finder at 25x and 
            the finder field contains M22 just 1.1&deg; SE. This HST image only 
            includes the central core region of the globular!<br>

            I viewed this unusual globular -just 2' S of Nu2 Sgr - at 375x and 
            500x. The &quot;core&quot; appeared as a fairly circular, fairly smooth 
            glow, ~1' diameter, with a half-dozen stars superimposed. With extended 
            viewing a very low surface, irregular halo was noticed that increased 
            the diameter to perhaps 2.5'. At the center is in unequal pair oriented 
            N-S (~5&quot; separation), with the southern component, brighter and 
            quasi-stellar. A second pair of mag 14 stars at ~5&quot; separation 
            is on the NE side (this is IC 4802). A mag 16 star is 10&quot; S of 
            this pair. Finally, another mag 14 star is at the WNW side of the 
            core.<br>

            Size: 2.9'; Mag: V = 11.7<br>
          </p>
          <p align="left">Picked up at 200x as a very low surface brightness 2.0'-2.5' 
            glow, peppered with a few stars and a slightly brighter &quot;core&quot; 
            region. At 375x-500x, the brightest mag 14.6 star is on the northwest 
            side with a mag 14.8 star 0.6' SE . A 12&quot; pair of mag 15.2/15.9 
            stars is near the geometric center (20&quot; SE of the mag 14.8 star) 
            and a mag 16-16.5 star was glimpsed on the northeast side. A brighter 
            mag 14 star is off the northwest side and probably not a member. Pal 
            12 is situated 2' northwest of a striking mag 11/12 triple, including 
            a 19&quot; pair of mag 11.7/12.3 stars.</p>

            Abell 51<br>

            Using 200x and NPB filter, Abell 51 appeared very faint but visible 
            continuously, round, crisp-edged, nearly even surface brightness. 
            Also viewed at 225x (with filter) and a couple of superimposed stars 
            were glimpsed. At 375x unfiltered, two mag 15-15.5 stars oriented 
            SW-NE were clearly visible at the position of the planetary. Checking 
            ALADIN afterwards, one is a mag 15.3 star at the SW end and the other 
            is the mag 15.4 central star.<br>

            22 02 06 -31 59 06<br>
            Size: 1.5'; Mag: V = 12.0/13.3/11.4 </p>
          <p align="left">This bright, compact triplet is part of the HCG 90 quartet, 
            along with NGC 7172. At 375x, NGC 7173 = KTS 66A = HCG 90C appeared 
            bright, moderately large, round, 45&quot; diameter. Contains a relatively 
            large, very bright core that gradually increases to the center. NGC 
            7174/7176 (contact pair) is less than 1.5' southeast. NGC 7174 = KTS 
            66B = HCG 90D is elongated perhaps 3:1 E-W, 0.9'x0.3'. The surface 
            brightness is irregular with no core region. The galaxy appears to 
            taper and brighten at the west end with a bend or short kink angling 
            northwest. The east end merges into the halo of NGC 7176 on the its 
            southwest end. NGC 7176 = KTS 66C = HCG 90B appeared very bright, 
            moderately large, round, 1.0' diameter, intense core that increases 
            to the center, which contains a bright, stellar nucleus. NGC 7172, 
            just 7' NNW, completes the HCG 90 quartet. This galaxy was logged 
            as moderately bright, fairly large, elongated 5:2 WNW-ESE, ~1.5'x0.6', 
            increases in size with averted. Contains a brighter, elongated core 
            that bulges slightly and the halo has a sharper edge along with south 
            edge.<br>

            Size: 2.1'x1.5' and 2.3'x1.4'; Mag: V = 12.1/11.9</p>
          <p align="left">NGC 7284 is the western component of this double system. 
            At 375x, it appeared bright, small, round, high surface brightness, 
            ~0.4' diameter. The core of NGC 7285 is cleanly resolved [33&quot; 
            between center], though very close northeast. The twin nuclei are 
            encased in a very low surface brightness halo. NGC 7285 is fairly 
            bright, small, elongated 3:2 E-W, 30&quot;x20&quot;, high surface 
            brightness.<br>

            23 18 22 -04 24 58<br>

          <p align="left"><br>
            Using 375x, this interacting pair appeared fairly faint, fairly small, 
            irregular. With careful viewing, the highest surface brightness component 
            is the core of the eastern galaxy (identified as NGC 7592B = Mrk 928 
            in NED), with most of the glow extending southwest, creating an asymmetric 
            appearance. The nucleus of the western galaxy (identified as NGC 7592A 
            in NED) appeared faint and extremely small, perhaps 5&quot; diameter. 
            The arm or wing to its north was not seen. The two nuclei are separated 
            by only 13&quot; as measured on ALADIN.<br>
          </p>
          <hr>

          </p>
          <p align="left"><br>
            At 375x, two thin &quot;wings&quot; or thin extensions were clearly 
            visible extending WSW and ENE from R Aquarii. The ENE spike was seen 
            first, so was very likely brighter and the WNW extension was not as 
            sharply defined. At 200x, the star had a definite pale orange color, 
            though the color was washed out at higher power. I didn't compare 
            views with a filter, but some reports indicate a mild improvement.</p>
