          <p>Sunny, warm days; socializing with old and new friends; dark, starlit nights. That's the perfect recipe for an excellent CalStar 2013 at Lake (currently a dry bed) San Antonio.
          With three all-nighters, there was plenty of time for loads of observations and sharing views with others.</p>
          <p>A few years back my 24" f/3.7 might have stood out as one of the largest scopes, but there seems to be a contagious case of aperture fever going around. I was set up next to Bob
          Douglas' 28" f/3.7 Starstructure, Alan Agrawal's 24" f/3.3 Starstructure, Rick Linden's 22" f/4.2 Obsession UC, Mark Johnston's 18" f/3.7 Starmaster and not far from Chris Ford's
          24" f/3.25 SpicaEyes, Albert Highe's 24" f/3.3 and Peter Natscher's 24" f/3.3 Starstructure! Of course, this is in addition to Paul Alsing's 25" f/5 Obsession that's been around
          forever.</p>
          <p>On all three nights (Oct 3, 4, 5) seeing started off soft and improved as the night went along. My mirror probably had a difficult time keeping up with the dropping temperatures,
          as it dipped into the low 30's on Thursday night -- a difference of 50 degrees from daytime highs! Nevertheless, I was able to use a quite respectable 375x on galaxies to resolve
          details. Transparency seemed off to me, compared to last year. SQM readings (from Mark Johnston) were around 21.4, pretty good but the Milky Way did not display it's dust lanes with
          the same contrast as a true dark site.</p>
          <p>On Saturday night, I focused mainly on observing small galaxy groups and Arp peculiar galaxies. The KTG designations are "Isolated Triplets of Galaxies" compiled in 1979 by
          Russian astronomers V.E. Karachentseva, I.D. Karachentsev and A.L. Shcherbanovskii. Their paper included 84 northern triplets mag 15.7 or brighter. The KTS designation is a similar
          catalogue covering the southern sky and includes 76 triplets. I've really enjoyed going through the trios in both of these catalogues, which is available for download as an
          observing guide (along with other trios) on Alvin Huey's web site: <a href=

            This bright trio is situated within the square of Pegasus, 1° NNW of 5.1-magnitude Phi Peg. At 260x, <x-dso>NGC 7769</x-dso> = KTG 82A appeared bright, fairly large, round, 1.6' diameter,
            sharply concentrated with a very bright core and stellar nucleus. The low surface brightness outer halo (spiral arms) is slightly elongated and gradually fades out. NGC 7769 is
            the brightest component of KTG 82 with <x-dso>NGC 7770</x-dso> and 7771 (1' pair) both 4.5' SE. <x-dso>NGC 7771</x-dso> also appeared bright, fairly large, very elongated 3:1 WSW-ENE, 2.0'x0.7', moderate
            concentration with a large, elongated core that gradually increases to the center. Forms a 1.1' pair with NGC 7770 = KTG 82B. This is the smallest member and appeared moderately
            bright, fairly small, elongated 5:3 SSW-NNE, 0.5'x0.3', with a small bright core.</p>

            small, 0.6' diameter, sharply concentrated with a small intensely bright core that gradually increases to the center, but no nucleus. This is the brighter but smaller component of
            a striking double system with <x-dso>NGC 275</x-dso> = KTS 7C, which is attached on the SE side. NGC 275 appeared moderately to fairly bright, elongated 5:3 NW-SE, ~45"x27". Very unusual patchy,
            irregular appearance! A brighter elongated N-S patch (or arm) is on the east end. Also the southwest border is slightly brighter with a sharp, curving edge. This edge is more
            prominent at the NW end of the galaxy, where it merges with NGC 274 just northwest. Finally, NGC 273 = KTS 7A is moderately bright and large, very elongated 3:1 WNW-ESE, ~48"x16".
            Contains a very small brighter core. A mag 14 star is off the NW edge by ~20".</p>

          This galaxy group is located 2° SE of the planetary <x-dso>NGC 246</x-dso> in Cetus. NGC 283 is the first and largest of five galaxies consisting of four similar NGCs and much fainter MCG
          -02-03-03, squeezed into a 5' circle. At 375x NGC 283 appeared fairly faint, moderately large, elongated 4:3 NNW-SSE, 0.4'x0.3', weak concentration. A mag 13.5 star lies 1.6' NE.
          <x-dso>NGC 284</x-dso> and 285 follow directly east by 2.7' and 4.1' with <x-dso>NGC 286</x-dso> 5.2' NE and much fainter <x-dso>PGC 173072</x-dso> is 1.9' NNE. NGC 284 is fairly faint, small, slightly elongated N-S, 20"x15".
          A mag 13.5 star lies 1.6' NW. Continuing on a line to the east, <x-dso>NGC 285</x-dso> is fairly faint, small, slightly elongated N-S, 18"x15", very small brighter nucleus. NGC 286, 3' due N,
          appeared fairly faint, fairly small, oval 4:3 N-S, 40"x30", weak concentration, small brighter nucleus. By a slight margin, this galaxy has the highest surface brightness in the
          group. Finally, PGC 173072 (misidentified as <x-dso>MCG -2-03-032</x-dso>) was an extremely faint and small glow, ~10" diameter, and required averted vision.<br></p>

          1623A, the brighter western component, appeared fairly bright, fairly small, round, 25" diameter, high surface brightness. <x-dso>IC 1634B</x-dso>, attached on the east end, appeared as a fairly
          faint, small glow that not separately resolved, just a bulge or knot on the east end. 365x revealed a broad concentration with a brighter nucleus. Research reveals the IC 1634B is
          optically obscured but very bright in the infrared indicating intense star formation. <x-dso>IC 1622</x-dso> lies 3.1' SW and appeared fairly faint, fairly small, round, 25" diameter. 365x

          This description appears to apply to the core region and the low surface brightness arms were not noticed. Forms a close pair with much fainter <x-dso>MCG +02-04-004</x-dso> 1.1' SE, though the
          companion is apparently in the background at 800 million l.y. A mag 12 star lies 2.3' WSW. MCG +02-04-004 appeared faint, very small, round, 10" diameter. <x-dso>UGC 719</x-dso>, just 2.1' NE,
          completes a nice compact triplet. I logged it as faint to fairly faint, small, slightly elongated ~N-S, ~24"x20", very weak concentration. The distance of this galaxy and UGC 719 is
