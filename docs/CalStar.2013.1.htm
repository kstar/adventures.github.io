        <p>Sunny, warm days; socializing with old and new friends; dark, starlit 
          nights. That's the perfect recipe for an excellent CalStar 2013 at Lake 
          (currently a dry bed) San Antonio. With three all-nighters, there was 
          plenty of time for loads of observations and sharing views with others. 
        </p>
        <p>A few years back my 24&quot; f/3.7 might have stood out as one of the 
          largest scopes, but there seems to be a contagious case of aperture 
          fever going around. I was set up next to Bob Douglas' 28&quot; f/3.7 
          Starstructure, Alan Agrawal's 24&quot; f/3.3 Starstructure, Rick Linden's 
          22&quot; f/4.2 Obsession UC, Mark Johnston's 18&quot; f/3.7 Starmaster 
          and not far from Chris Ford's 24&quot; f/3.25 SpicaEyes, Albert Highe's 
          24&quot; f/3.3 and Peter Natscher's 24&quot; f/3.3 Starstructure! Of 
          course, this is in addition to Paul Alsing's 25&quot; f/5 Obsession 
          that's been around forever.</p>
        <p>On all three nights (Oct 3, 4, 5) seeing started off soft and improved 
          as the night went along. My mirror probably had a difficult time keeping 
          up with the dropping temperatures, as it dipped into the low 30's on 
          Thursday night -- a difference of 50 degrees from daytime highs! Nevertheless, 
          I was able to use a quite respectable 375x on galaxies to resolve details. 
          Transparency seemed off to me, compared to last year. SQM readings (from 
          Mark Johnston) were around 21.4, pretty good but the Milky Way did not 
          display it's dust lanes with the same contrast as a true dark site.</p>
        <p>On Saturday night, I focused mainly on observing small galaxy groups 
          and Arp peculiar galaxies. The KTG designations are &quot;Isolated Triplets 
          of Galaxies&quot; compiled in 1979 by Russian astronomers V.E. Karachentseva, 
          I.D. Karachentsev and A.L. Shcherbanovskii. Their paper included 84 
          northern triplets mag 15.7 or brighter. The KTS designation is a similar 
          catalogue covering the southern sky and includes 76 triplets. I've really 
          enjoyed going through the trios in both of these catalogues, which is 
          available for download as an observing guide (along with other trios) 
          on Alvin Huey's web site: <a href="http://www.faintfuzzies.com/DownloadableObservingGuides2.html">http://www.faintfuzzies.com/DownloadableObservingGuides2.html</a></p>

            This bright trio is situated within the square of Pegasus, 1&deg; 
            NNW of 5.1-magnitude Phi Peg. At 260x, NGC 7769 = KTG 82A appeared 
            bright, fairly large, round, 1.6' diameter, sharply concentrated with 
            a very bright core and stellar nucleus. The low surface brightness 
            outer halo (spiral arms) is slightly elongated and gradually fades 
            out. NGC 7769 is the brightest component of KTG 82 with NGC 7770 and 
            7771 (1' pair) both 4.5' SE. NGC 7771 also appeared bright, fairly 
            large, very elongated 3:1 WSW-ENE, 2.0'x0.7', moderate concentration 
            with a large, elongated core that gradually increases to the center. 
            Forms a 1.1' pair with NGC 7770 = KTG 82B. This is the smallest member 
            and appeared moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 5:3 SSW-NNE, 
            0.5'x0.3', with a small bright core.</p>

            This triplet consists of the contact pair NGC 274/275 = Arp 140 = 
            VV 81, along with NGC 273 11' NW. At 75x, the brightest member NGC 
            274 = KTS 7B appeared bright, round, fairly small, 0.6' diameter, 
            sharply concentrated with a small intensely bright core that gradually 
            increases to the center, but no nucleus. This is the brighter but 
            smaller component of a striking double system with NGC 275 = KTS 7C, 
            which is attached on the SE side. NGC 275 appeared moderately to fairly 
            bright, elongated 5:3 NW-SE, ~45&quot;x27&quot;. Very unusual patchy, 
            irregular appearance! A brighter elongated N-S patch (or arm) is on 
            the east end. Also the southwest border is slightly brighter with 
            a sharp, curving edge. This edge is more prominent at the NW end of 
            the galaxy, where it merges with NGC 274 just northwest. Finally, 
            NGC 273 = KTS 7A is moderately bright and large, very elongated 3:1 
            WNW-ESE, ~48&quot;x16&quot;. Contains a very small brighter core. 
            A mag 14 star is off the NW edge by ~20&quot;.</p>

          This galaxy group is located 2&deg; SE of the planetary NGC 246 in Cetus. 
          NGC 283 is the first and largest of five galaxies consisting of four 
          similar NGCs and much fainter MCG -02-03-03, squeezed into a 5' circle. 
          At 375x NGC 283 appeared fairly faint, moderately large, elongated 4:3 
          NNW-SSE, 0.4'x0.3', weak concentration. A mag 13.5 star lies 1.6' NE. 
          NGC 284 and 285 follow directly east by 2.7' and 4.1' with NGC 286 5.2' 
          NE and much fainter PGC 173072 is 1.9' NNE. NGC 284 is fairly faint, 
          small, slightly elongated N-S, 20&quot;x15&quot;. A mag 13.5 star lies 
          1.6' NW. Continuing on a line to the east, NGC 285 is fairly faint, 
          small, slightly elongated N-S, 18&quot;x15&quot;, very small brighter 
          nucleus. NGC 286, 3' due N, appeared fairly faint, fairly small, oval 
          4:3 N-S, 40&quot;x30&quot;, weak concentration, small brighter nucleus. 
          By a slight margin, this galaxy has the highest surface brightness in 
          the group. Finally, PGC 173072 (misidentified as MCG -2-03-032) was 
          an extremely faint and small glow, ~10&quot; diameter, and required 
          averted vision.<br>

          KTG 2A = NGC 317A and KTG 2B = NGC 317B form a contact pair oriented 
          NNW-SSE, just 35&quot; between centers. At 375x, KTG 2A appeared fairly 
          faint to moderately bright, small, fairly high surface brightness (core 
          region) ~15&quot;. With averted vision, the core is surrounded by a 
          thin, very low surface brightness halo increasing the diameter to 25&quot;. 
          KTG 2B appeared fairly faint, very elongated WNW-ESE, ~45&quot;x15&quot;, 
          weak concentration, slightly brighter core. Two mag 11.5/13.8 stars 
          lie 1' W. A group of mag 10-13 stars is roughly 4' S and CGCG 536-014

          Arp 236 = VV 114 is in the Arp category of &quot;appearance of fission&quot;, 
          though this contact pair is apparently undergoing a merger and the two 
          nuclei are separated by only 15&quot;! IC 1623A, the brighter western 
          component, appeared fairly bright, fairly small, round, 25&quot; diameter, 
          high surface brightness. IC 1634B, attached on the east end, appeared 
          as a fairly faint, small glow that not separately resolved, just a bulge 
          or knot on the east end. 365x revealed a broad concentration with a 
          brighter nucleus. Research reveals the IC 1634B is optically obscured 
          but very bright in the infrared indicating intense star formation. IC 
          1622 lies 3.1' SW and appeared fairly faint, fairly small, round, 25&quot; 
          diameter. 365x revealed a broad concentration with a brighter nucleus.

          UGC 717 = Arp 11 (category &quot;Spiral Galaxies: split arm&quot;) is 
          the brightest in a small triplet. At 375x it appeared fairly faint, 
          fairly small, round, 35&quot;, even surface brightness. This description 
          appears to apply to the core region and the low surface brightness arms 
          were not noticed. Forms a close pair with much fainter MCG +02-04-004 
          1.1' SE, though the companion is apparently in the background at 800 
          million l.y. A mag 12 star lies 2.3' WSW. MCG +02-04-004 appeared faint, 
          very small, round, 10&quot; diameter. UGC 719, just 2.1' NE, completes 
          a nice compact triplet. I logged it as faint to fairly faint, small, 
          slightly elongated ~N-S, ~24&quot;x20&quot;, very weak concentration.

          It features an offset nucleus on the north side, a spike or filament
