              located 3.0' NE of the center of M87, directly opposite the two small galaxies at the SW edge of the halo of M87. A mag 14.5 star, just 20" SSW, is a perfect reference to focus
              on the cluster. At 488x it was suspected as an 18th magnitde "star", but I didn't feel confident of the observation. At 813x, though, it was confirmed as an extremely faint,
              stellar object, glimpsed several times at the same position.<br>
              <br>
              Virgo UCD 7 48" is listed as the brightest of 9 Ultra Compact Dwarfs (UCD) discovered near M87 in the 2006 paper "Discovery of ultracompact dwarf galaxies in the Virgo cluster"
              (AJ, 131, 312). At 610x it appeared extremely faint (V = 17.7) and small, but definitely non-stellar, perhaps 6" diameter. Often this UCD hovered just at the edge of visibility
              but sometimes it clearly popped as a distinct, low surface brightness glow and could be confirmed. Situated nearly at the midpoint of two mag 10.8/11.5 stars 6.7' apart at the
              edge of the field. Located 17' SE of the center of M87. This was the second UCD we observed, earlier having glimpsed Virgo UCD 3, just off the NE edge of M87.<br>
              <br>
              Formation scenarios for UCDs include the remnant nucleus of a stripped dwarf galaxy or a rare surviving relic of a dwarf galaxy formed in the early Universe . Star cluster
              origins include the merger of several smaller star clusters or an extension of the globular cluster sequence to higher masses. Multiple origins are also possible. It is
              debatable whether they should be considered massive star clusters or a new class of galaxy in general, though Virgo UCD 7 has an extended envelope of stars and may be a
              transition object between nucleated dwarfs and (envelope-free) UCDs.</td>
