    <h3>ARP 18 (<x-dso>NGC 4088</x-dso>)<br>
    Spiral Galaxy with Detached Segments in Ursa Major</h3><img src="assets/arp018.jpg" width="50%">
  </center>N4088 = U07081 = M+09-20-089 = Arp 18<br>
  17.5: bright, fairly large, elongated 5:2 SW-NE, 5.0'x2.0', mottled patchy appearance, small elongated brighter core but no nucleus. A mag 15 star is 2' off the NW side. Faint spiral
  structure visible with concentration. An extremely faint arm is off the NE end curving towards a mag 14.5 star to the NE 3.7' from center and a second extremely faint arm is just visible
  off the SW end curving to the S. Forms a pair with N4085 11' SSW.<br>
  8: fairly bright, elongated SW-NE, weak concentration, cigar-shaped. Forms a pair with N4085 11' SSW.

  </center>N4027 = E572-037 = M-03-31-008 = Arp 22 = VV 66<br>
  13: fairly bright, round, moderately large, broad concentration, possible stellar nucleus. A mag 14 star is off the ENE edge 1.0' from center. A spiral arm is suspected N of the nucleus
  trailing to the E.<br>
  8: faint, moderately large, no details.

  </center>N5394 = U08898 = M+06-31-033 = Z191-024 = Arp 84 = VV 48<br>
  17.5: this is the fainter northern member of a contact system with brighter N5395 connected at the S tip (2.0' between centers)! Fairly faint, very small, round, brighter core.
  <p>N5395 = U08900 = M+06-31-034 = Z191-026 = Arp 84 = VV 48<br>
  17.5: fairly bright, elongated NNW-SSE, bright core, small bright nucleus. A mag 13.5 star is off the S edge 1.7' from center. There is an impression of a dark lane on the W side and an
  extremely faint arm beyond the lane (agrees with POSS). Forms a contact system with N5394 at the NNW edge!</p>

  17.5: moderately bright, moderately large, slightly elongated SSW-NNE, smoothly increases from halo to a bright core and an almost stellar nucleus. The halo extends to almost 2' diameter
  with averted vision and fades into background. Forms a striking pair with N3227 at the S side with 2.3' separation between centers. The outer halo is just in contact with N3227 at the SSE
  edge. N3222 lies 13' W.

  17.5: fairly bright, fairly bright, elongated 5:2 NW-SE, 2.5'x1.0', prominent very small high surface brightness core, striking stellar nucleus. Just in contact with N3226 at the NW tip
  2.3' separation between cores. Brightest of three with N3222 13' W.<br>
  13: fairly bright, elongated, bright core, stellar nucleus. Forms a contact system with N3226 2' NNW.</p>
