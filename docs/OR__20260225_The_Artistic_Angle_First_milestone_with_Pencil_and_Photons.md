Quick introduction, this is Snehith from Bangalore. After a decade in IT,
I transitioned to full-time farming in 2022, allowing more space for my
lifelong passion for astronomy. While my primary focus is
astrophotography, I also volunteer with the [Bangalore Astronomical
Society](https://bas.org.in) to conduct public outreach to promote astronomy.

This report documents my first visual sketch and observations using 8-inch
and 12-inch Dobsonian telescopes. These observations were recorded during a
star party in Coorg, a high-altitude location offering Bortle 4
conditions, situated roughly seven hours from Bangalore. The idea was to
see the difference of these objects with two different scopes to get the
aperture fever (Well that is what visual observers are calling it right
?)

## Observation Log

### Target 1: Jupiter (The Warm-Up)

I started with Jupiter to test the seeing conditions after collimating
the 8-inch scope with help of a friend. The planet was crisp, showing the
two main equatorial bands clearly and the 4 moons were visible. However,
switching to the 12-inch was a revelation. The extra resolution didn't just
make it brighter but sharpened the edges of the cloud belts. I could
make out irregularities in the belt, however the Giant red spot was not
visible. This was also an easy target in the sky to point at and start
the proceedings.

### Target 2: Saturn (The Challenge)

The object was in the west and setting quickly behind the mountain area,
and the 8-inch f/5 really needed me to bend giving a nice workout to my back.
It was not easy to get the object into the Telrad and the scope was almost
parallel to the ground. After some moving around and hunting, I brought the
object to the center of the eyepiece using a 30mm one, and the rings were
bright and distinct and Titan was just a small dot. I just enjoyed
the 3D view and moved on.

### Target 3: <x-dso simbad="M 42">The Orion Nebula</x-dso> (M42 - First Sketch)

This was the highlight and the reason being I spent a good amount of
time observing and sketching it. In the 8-inch the nebula was beautiful and
glowing like a bird -- more like a raptor -- and I was able to resolve 3 stars
of the Trapezium. I noticed a distinct greenish tint that I hadn't
expected. Moving to the 12-inch , the wings of the nebula extended much
further out, looping back around to create a full wreath of nebulosity.
Even though I was using a 10mm eyepiece, I still could not resolve the
trapezium, not sure if it was my viewing or the sky conditions.

Random fact: I can easily identify 200+ bird species with ease, and this
helped me to sketch the nebula thinking it is like a bird. It was indeed
difficult without light however, I used a mild red light and covered my
head area with a bed spread, sneaking out every now and then to get
the shading started. The more I observed, the more I was able to identify the
darker regions towards the head and wing region and I added the tones on
the sketch. Then I added the stars visible when I scanned through the
eyepiece, to be honest I hope these are stars :)! Here is the outcome of
the sketch which thoroughly made my day and I showed it to some of the
other visual observers in the early morning to get some feedback. One of them
asked me if it was the Seagull Nebulla; well atleast it is still a bird haha!

### Target 4: The <x-dso>Crab Nebula</x-dso> (M1)

This was the reality check of the night. I had high hopes again. It was
not easy to get the target in the Telrad because you are not looking at
a bright star or a planet. With the help of Stellarium, I started to look
toward Taurus, which sits high in the evening sky. Beginning at Aldebaran,
the bright reddish eye of the bull, I followed the V-shape of the face
upward to find the star Zeta Tauri, then moved my telescope roughly one
degree towards the northwest. In my 8-inch using a 30mm eyepiece, the nebula did not
appear as a bright star, but rather as a subtle, ghostly smudge of
light. Because it is faint, I had to use averted vision (looking slightly
to the side of the object) to allow its oval shape to materialize
against the dark background.

M1 was merely a faint, oval smudge and ghostly fingerprint on the
eyepiece that required averted vision to hold steady. The 12-inch made
detection easier, brightening the smudge significantly, but it still
refused to show the complex filaments seen in photographs. It remained a
featureless, grey puff of smoke, but knowing I was looking at the
wreckage of a star that exploded ages ago gave me chills considering it
was a Supernova Remnant. A difficult target. Unlike the crisp stars
around it, the Crab appeared as a soft, diffuse glow. No color was
visible, just a grey phantom against the black sky.

I did sketch this nebula as well but it was just showing up as a
poop-stuck-in-some-kind-of-haphazard-net-shaped-structure, hence not
sharing it :)

### Target 5: The Leo Triplet (<x-dso>M65</x-dso>, <x-dso>M66</x-dso>, <x-dso>NGC 3628</x-dso>)

I finished the night with this galaxy group. Finding them was much
easier since this was also my astrophotograph target for 2 straight
nights. In the 8-inch M65 and M66 were obvious fuzzy ovals with bright cores
but the third member NGC 3628 (The Hamburger Galaxy) was extremely faint
and ghost like. The 12-inch did not make much difference but NGC 3628 popped
into view as a distinct edge-on streak and I could make out the dark
dust lane cutting through its center, albeit not very distinctly. It is probably
because of the haziness in the sky. Seeing the galactic trio in a single
field of view using a 30mm wide-angle eyepiece was simply a superb
experience, M66 appeared the brightest and most distorted, while the
edge on NGC 3628 looked large but diffuse.
