          Here are some observations of interesting galaxies I made earlier in July at the Golden State Star Party with my 24" f/3.7 Starstructure. All nights of the star party were clear --
          probably a first -- and SQM readings were generally in the 21.5-21.6 range. Recently, one of my observing projects has been targets from Russian astronomer Boris
          Vorontsov-Velyaminov's 1959 "Atlas and Catalogue of Interacting Galaxies", which contained photographs of 355 systems, the majority of which he discovered on Palomar Observatory Sky
          Survey plates (1949-1956). Up to that point, extragalactic research had focused predominately on "well-behaved" spirals and ellipticals, but Vorontsov-Velyaminov was fascinated by
          interacting and merging galaxies (both <x-dso>M51</x-dso>-type and multiple systems), bridges, tails, condensations and fragments.
          <p>V-V's atlas, published by the Sternberg Astronomical Institute in Moscow and not easily accessible, never received the widespread recognition it deserved. But it caught the
          attention of Halton Arp and was instrumental in the development of his "Atlas of Peculiar and Interacting Galaxies" (1966), with over half of the 338 entries in Arp's catalogue
          appearing earlier in V-V's 1959 publication. In 1977 Vorontsov-Velyaminov published part II of his catalogue and atlas, expanding his list of interacting systems to 852.</p>

              appears to be a merging pair of compacts with tidally distorted arms that loop and intersect each other.</td>

              At 322x this interacting pair of compact galaxies was just resolved. The brighter (starburst) component is on the south end and appeared fairly faint, fairly small, elongated
              N-S, ~24"x12", contains a very small brighter nucleus offset towards the north end. A very faint, extremely small companion is barely detached in steady moments at the north
              end, appearing as an 8" round knot. Generally, though, the two objects blend together into a single elongated glow.</td>

                  faint, very small glow, ~10" diameter. VV 560 is an interacting pair of disturbed spirals. On the SDSS, the pair has a "Sickle" shape, with the fainter curved section at the
                  north end and the elongated "handle" at the south end.
