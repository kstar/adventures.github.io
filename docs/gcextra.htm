    <h1>Extragalactic Globulars</h1>
    <h2>The Brightest Globular Cluster in Eight Nearby Galaxies</h2>
  </center>You might wonder why anybody in his right mind would spend hours searching for something that looks just like another field star, and a damn faint one at that. Well, we all enjoy
  looking at Pluto, don't we? Why? Just because it is Pluto, I guess. Likewise with quasars; it is cool to find something that is so far away! Globular clusters in other galaxies are like
  that. They are not much to look at, but it is pretty neat to track down a certain pinpoint of light and realize that it is actually a swarm of thousands of stars comparable to <x-dso>M13</x-dso> or Omega
  Centauri in our own galaxy, but immensely further away! It helps, I guess, if you are the kind of deep sky observer who enjoys tackling new and offbeat targets, and for whom it is often the
  journey, and not the arrival, that matters.

  <p>Although not strictly speaking <i>extragalactic</i>, several globular clusters, the brightest of which is <x-dso>M54</x-dso>, belong to the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, which is being absorbed
  into the Milky Way:</p>
  <p><i>One needs to take some care regarding the nomenclature and categorization of objects in the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy. This galaxy has already been captured by the Milky Way and is
  inside it and being incorporated into it. Therefore objects in it are no longer "extragalactic" (assuming that term simply means objects outside the Milky Way), even if they were in the
  distant past. I've had to deal with this problem in writing I'm doing on the four SD globular clusters. One has to be careful to consider/catalogue these objects as in _both_ the SD and the
  Milky Way. Further complicating things is <x-dso>M 54</x-dso>, which while filling all the requirements of a globular cluster in both galaxies is almost certainly the nucleus of the SD as well. The "dual
  residency" and nature (for M 54) of these objects is certainly interesting however, and they're all worthwhile observing targets.</i> - Brent Archinal</p>
  <p>Other globular clusters belonging to the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical are <a href="july.htm#arp2"><x-dso>Arp 2</x-dso></a> and <a href="obscure.htm">Terzan 7 and 8</a>.</p>

        and the southernmost is double. Then find a 12th-magnitude star on the SW leg of the triangle. The globular is about 1' S of this star and is visible with averted vision in a 17.5"
        scope as a slightly fuzzy star. There are several very faint stars in the same immediate area that make positive identification of the object more difficult.

        The local group galaxy known as "WLM" is named for its discoverers early in the 20th century. Wolf first reported the galaxy in 1909 after photographing the object with a 6-inch
        camera and the 28-inch Waltz reflector in Heidelburg. Nearly twenty years later, the galaxy was 'rediscovered' by Lundmark and Melotte (1926) during the inspection of older
        photographic plates. WLM is an easily resolved irregular galaxy that was often a target for Hubble and Baade during the 1920's and 30's. Today, the WLM system is classified as a dwarf
        irregular galaxy.

        NGC 185 and NGC 147 are dwarf elliptical companions of M31 lying about one degree apart and some seven degrees north of M31 itself. Walter Baade first noted the existence of two

        <p>To attempt the brightest of the remaining four (Hodge 5), locate a clump of stars about 3.5' NE of the center of the galaxy. The brightest star in the group is mag 11.7, with two

        Walter Baade also identified two globular clusters and a semistellar nucleus in NGC 147. Interestingly, Paul Hodge found that this apparent nucleus (Hodge 1 - mag 17.7; just E of a
        mag 13.7 field star) is displaced slightly from the center of light distribution. Based upon its color (bluer than the galaxy), he suggested that it is more likely to be a globular
        cluster.
        <p>The brightest globular in NGC 147 (Hodge 3) lies about 3.2' S of the center of the galaxy and 1.5' NW of a mag 12.7 field star. As far as I know, there have been no successful
