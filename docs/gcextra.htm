<h2>The Brightest Globular Cluster in Eight Nearby Galaxies</h2></center>

You might wonder why anybody in his right mind would spend hours searching for something that looks just like another field star, and a damn faint one at that. Well, we all enjoy looking at Pluto, don't we? Why? Just because it is Pluto, I guess. Likewise with quasars; it is cool to find something that is so far away! Globular clusters in other galaxies are like that. They are not much to look at, but it is pretty neat to track down a certain pinpoint of light and realize that it is actually a swarm of thousands of stars comparable to M13 or Omega Centauri in our own galaxy, but immensely further away! It helps, I guess, if you are the kind of deep sky observer who enjoys tackling new and offbeat targets, and for whom it is often the journey, and not the arrival, that matters.<p>

Although not strictly speaking <i>extragalactic</i>, several globular clusters, the brightest of which is M54, belong to the  Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, which is being absorbed into the Milky Way:<p>
<i>One needs to take some care regarding the
nomenclature and categorization of objects in the Sagittarius Dwarf
galaxy.  This galaxy has already been captured by the Milky Way and is
inside it and being incorporated into it.  Therefore objects in it are no
longer "extragalactic" (assuming that term simply means objects outside
the Milky Way), even if they were in the distant past.  I've had to deal
with this problem in writing I'm doing on the four SD globular clusters.
One has to be careful to consider/catalogue these objects as in _both_ the
SD and the Milky Way.  Further complicating things is M 54, which while
filling all the requirements of a globular cluster in both galaxies is
almost certainly the nucleus of the SD as well.  The "dual residency" and
nature (for M 54) of these objects is certainly interesting however, and
they're all worthwhile observing targets.</i> - Brent Archinal<p>

In his survey of M31 globulars, Steve Gottlieb has included his observation of the brightest of the eight:<p>

<i>Very faint, visible with direct vision as a 15th magnitude star, on line
with a mag 8.5 star 2.5' north and mag 10 star 6.5' north. Located 6' east
of the center of M110.</i>

</TD><TD WIDTH=390>To find C39, the brightest globular in the Triangulum Galaxy, look for an equilateral triangle of 10th-magnitude stars about 22' SE of the M33's nucleus. The stars are about 7' apart and the southernmost is double. Then find a 12th-magnitude star on the SW leg of the triangle. The globular is about 1' S of this star and is visible with averted vision in a 17.5" scope as a slightly fuzzy star. There are several very faint stars in the same immediate area that make positive identification of the object more difficult.<p>

Mag (V) = 16.1<p>
<img src="images/gcwlm.jpg" width="318" height="339"></center>

</TD><TD WIDTH=390>The local group galaxy known as &quot;WLM&quot; is named for its
discoverers early in the 20th century. Wolf first reported the
galaxy in 1909 after photographing the object with a 6-inch camera
and the 28-inch Waltz reflector in Heidelburg. Nearly twenty years
later, the galaxy was 'rediscovered' by Lundmark and Melotte (1926) during
the inspection of older photographic plates. WLM is an easily resolved irregular galaxy
that was often a target for Hubble and Baade during the 1920's
and 30's. Today, the WLM system is classified as a dwarf irregular galaxy.<p>

<i>20-inch f/4.5 at 175x: A large, fairly weak glow oriented north-south
and located in a region of faint stars. The object is elongated
~ 2:1 and has a weakly mottled surface. The globular cluster was only suspected 
in this FOV.</i> - Rich Jakiel

NGC 185<br>
Mag (V) = 16.7<p>
<img src="images/gc185.jpg" width="309" height="317"></center>

</TD><TD WIDTH=390>NGC 185 and NGC 147 are dwarf elliptical companions of M31 lying about one degree apart and some seven degrees north of M31 itself. Walter Baade first noted the existence of two probable globular clusters in NGC 185 in 1944, and Paul Hodge later identified three more candidates. Hodge 2 (not shown) was later determined to be a background galaxy.<p>

To attempt the brightest of the remaining four (Hodge 5), locate a clump of stars about 3.5' NE of the center of the galaxy. The brightest star in the group is mag 11.7, with two 14th magnitude stars just W. Then use high power and look for a much fainter pair of stars within 1' E of the bright star. This pair forms a roughly equilateral triangle with Hodge 5 at the southern apex. Jens Bohle has reported a successful observation: <p><i>I observed FJJ 5 </i>[=Hodge 5] <i> in NGC 185 last fall. It appeared to me stellar
and only visible with averted vision less than 50% of the time. </i>

<img src="images/gc147.jpg" width="306" height="320"></center>

</TD><TD WIDTH=390>Walter Baade also identified two globular clusters and a semistellar nucleus in NGC 147. Interestingly, Paul Hodge found that this apparent nucleus (Hodge 1 - mag 17.7; just E of a mag 13.7 field star) is displaced slightly from the center of light distribution. Based upon its color (bluer than the galaxy), he suggested that it is more likely to be a globular cluster.<P>

The brightest globular in NGC 147 (Hodge 3) lies about 3.2' S of the center of the galaxy and  1.5' NW of a mag 12.7 field star. As far as I know, there have been no successful observations of the globulars in NGC 147. Let me know if you have seen them.<P>
