Compact galaxy groups hold a special fascination and challenge for many

deep sky observers.  I've often heard someone call out at a star party:<br>

<center>"Who knows how to find Stephan's Quintet?"<br>

A more experienced observer

responds:<br> "Near NGC 7331 in Pegasus.  Let's see if you can find it in your

new scope."</center><br>



Fifteen  minutes later, I'll hear shouts of joy as someone has bagged his first tough

deep sky object.  Although the unimpressive view consists of only a few dim

patches, this catch has confirmed his finding techniques, telescope optics

and visual acuity. Its being a fascinating interacting galaxy group adds to

the excitement.<p>

Perhaps you've wondered whether there are other lesser known compact galaxy

groups which could provide a more challenging test than Stephan's Quintet?

One of the best sources for information is Paul Hickson's <i>Atlas of Compact Groups of

Galaxies.</i>  His original paper in the Astronomical Journal, 255:382-391,

1982 provides catalogue data and identification charts for 100 very compact

groups based on a systematic search of the POSS red prints. In a follow-up

article in Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 70:687-698, 1989

detailed photometric data is presented on the 463 galaxies comprising these

100 groups.  To qualify for inclusion a compact group had to meet 3 rigid

criteria: 1) population--at least 4 members, 2) compactness--surface

brightness greater than 26.0/arcsec2 averaged over the smallest circle

containing their geometric centers, 3) isolation--to exclude condensations

in rich Abell galaxy clusters.<p>  

 



<a href="hickcatalog.htm"> <h3>Complete Hickson Catalog</h3></a><p>



Basic observational data for all 100 compact galaxy groups in the Hickson Catalog, compiled in a <i>user-friendly</i> form by Miles Paul.  I found this listing much more useful than the published version. The body of the listing is in basic text format, suitable for importing into popular software programs such as TheSky.<p> 



<a href="hicklist.htm"> <h3><i>Interesting</i> Hickson Groups</h3> </a><p>

By <i>interesting</i> I mean compact groups in which I was able to observe and identify at least three galaxies in a 17.5-inch scope. Of the 74 Hickson groups I have observed, 32 qualify as interesting under this definition. From here you can link to charts and tables for all 32 selected groups.<P>

These are the same high power ID charts, based upon DSS images, that Ray Cash, Steve Gottlieb and I use to identify the members of various compact groups. Also included are tables of observational data for the individual members. All charts have North up and West to the right. The charts are to roughly the same scale; each represents an eyepiece field of approximately 15 X 20 arcminutes.<P>


<a href="triplets.htm"><h3>Compact Galaxy Triplets</h3></a><p>

Compact groups of three galaxies didn't qualify for the original <i>Hickson Atlas</i>, but there are lots of interesting ones. Miles Paul compiled this list of 118 of his favorites.<p> 



<a href="http://members.aol.com/anonglxy/combine.htm"> <h3>Ray Cash's Compilation of Hickson Observing Notes</h3></a><p>

Two observing buddies, Ray Cash and Steve Gottlieb, have made a systematic attempt to observe as many Hickson groups as possible in their 17.5-inch scopes.  Sometimes I let them do all the work and just enjoy the view. (Having them around is better than digital setting circles!) I can't lend you Ray or Steve, but  Ray has collected their observing notes at his Website.<p>
