            Last week, Dan Smiley, Jim Molinari and I observed for three nights at the "Albaugh Ranch Guest House” — not in Adin, but just outside of McArthur (off of 299) on Pitville Road at
            an elevation of 3312 ft. The trip was almost cancelled due to a questionable weather forecast a week before arrival, but fortunately Dan decided to take a chance on keeping the
            reservation and we were rewarded with three clear nights. This was my first time observing at this location, though a number of years ago, Carter Scholz, along with Doug and Angie
            Traeger had checked it out and gave a positive review. My wife also came along, partly to view the Perseids on Saturday night and to visit Lassen, which is an hour drive to the
            west and south. We spent Saturday afternoon strolling around Manzanita Lake on a gorgeous day. When we returned back to the Loomis museum at the north entrance to Lassen, there
            were a couple of amateurs outside with solar scopes. They were part of a group planning to host a star party near the campground in the evening.</p>
            <p>The owners provided access to a grass field just above the house, which proved very convenient to set up our scopes and for easy access to the house. There were no exterior
            lights around the house, but depending where you were standing on the field, there were some visible street lights and neighbor lights along Pittville Rd, as well as perhaps from
            McArthur. Also, a surprising number of cars drove along Pitville Rd. at night, although there was no direct impact from the headlights -- they just distracted the peaceful
            setting. Light pollution maps show the site within a grey zone, though the location is fairly close to Fall River Mills (population 616) and of course, McArthur (pop. 334), which
            had minimal light domes.</p>
            <p>I brought along my 14.5” Starmaster, Jim Molinari had his 22” UC Obsession and Dan Smiley used his 12” New Moon scope (as well as his night-vision device, which I used one
            night). I logged 64 objects over the three nights — I wasn’t sure if the 14.5” would pull in 15th mag UGC galaxies in the Milky Way, but I recorded 15 of these on two of the
            nights. Here’s a sample of the objects.</p>

            <p align="left">C/2023 E1 (Atlas): this comet had moved from Draco last month (viewed at Lake Sonoma and near the east side of the Pinnacles) to Cygnus. It was situated in a rich
            star field close to a small clump of stars at 21 29 51 +50 14. The comet is fading, but was still obvious and fairly large.</p>
            <p align="left">Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks. Appeared as a 13th mag diffuse glow with little or no concentration, round, 2' diameter. This comet had an unusually large outburst on July
            19th, going from mag 16.6 to mag 11.6 overnight. This comet was discovered by French astronomer Jean-Louis Pons in July 1812. With an orbital period of 71 years, it is one of the
            brightest "Halley-type" and will reach a maximum mag of 4-4.5 in April '24, though low in the western sky during evening twilight.<br>

            <p align="left">I picked up this compact planetary at 158x as a pale blue soft 11th mag "star" in a very rich star field. It forms the NW vertex of an isosceles triangle with a
            mag 10.2 star 1.5' E and a mag 11.3 star 0.8' S. There was an excellent contrast gain with a NPB filter and the PN appeared far more prominent that the mag 10.2 star. At 226x a
            very small disc is resolved and 395x shows a small, easily resolved blue disc. At 566x, NGC 6886 appeared irregular but not clearly annular. British astronomer Ralph Copeland
            discovered NGC 6886 in 1884 at Dun Echt, Scotland, using a direct vision prism attached in front of the objective of his 6.1-inch refractor.</p>

            <p align="left"><br>
            A bright, high surface brightness blue disc was resolved at 140x and the planetary became even more prominent in the field adding a NPB filter. At 226x the central star was
            visible in a very high surface brightness disc, which appeared to be encased in a fainter halo. At 395x, the central star was easier to view, but the seeing wouldn't support any
            higher power. A mag 12.2 star is 1' WNW.<br>
            8" (6/29/84): fairly high surface brightness, small blue disk. I’ve previously viewed this tiny planetary in my 80mm finder (confirmed by blinking), though it appeared stellar, as
            well as my 18” and 24”.</p>
            <p align="left">Again, Ralph Copeland discovered NGC 6891 in September 1884 while sweeping the Milky Way with his large refractor. He remarked "this seems to be identical with the
            9.5 mag star DM +12°4266. It is in reality a planetary nebula about 4" in diameter with a nearly monochromatic spectrum.”</p>
