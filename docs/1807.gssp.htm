      <td valign="top">Last week I spend 5 nights at the Golden State Star Party 
        (GSSP) on the Albaugh's Frosty Acres ranch, located in the northeast corner 
        of the state on the Modoc plateau. I&#146;ve attended all 11 of the previous 
        GSSPs at this location since 2008 (as well as nearly all the earlier versions 
        at Lassen NP and the Shingletown airstrip) and always look forward to 
        getting together with friends under dark skies in a great location. 
        <p>I believe attendance this year was about 400 (from California, Oregon, 
          Washington, Nevada, Texas and ?), spread out over a fairly large cow 
          pasture. The row I was set up on was packed with a number of large telescopes, 
          including Howard Banich's 32-inch, Rick Linden's 28-inch Webster and 
          Bob Douglas' 28-inch Starstructure. The two best nights of the star 
          party were Tuesday and Wednesday (first official day). Clouds arrived 
          after midnight on Thursday, so we only had a good half-night before 
          the skies became too murky. Then after a mostly cloudy Friday night, 
          skies were clear until late on Saturday night. Afternoon temperatures 
          soared a few of the days (mid 90's?), though I generally stayed cool 
          in a motel a couple of miles away in Adin. But there are several attractions 
          in this area of the state to escape the heat including Lava Beds National 
          Monument, Lassen NP, Burney Falls and the Warner Mountains. Evenings 
          were very pleasant and I mostly just wore a sweater in the early evening 
          and a light jacket later on.</p>
        <p>Over 3&frac12; nights I logged about 100 objects using my 24-inch f/3.7 
          Starstructure, observing together with Jimi Lowrey. Here&#146;s a selection 
          of a dozen of the most interesting targets. Images are from the Sloan 
          Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) or the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS2).</p>

            UGC 3211A = PGC 17485<br>

            Size 1.0'x0.4'</p>
          <p align="left">A couple of years ago I wrote an article for Sky &amp; 
            Telescope titled &#147;A Trip to the Northern Frontier&#148;, which 
            was a tour of the galaxies north of +85&deg; declination using observations 
            with my 18&#148; Starmaster. The northernmost NGC galaxy I discussed 
            was NGC 3172. Amazingly, when John Herschel discovered this galaxy 
            in 1831, its coordinates were 04h 15m 09s +89&deg; 55&#146; 31&#148;. 
            In other words it was only 4.5&#146; from the north celestial pole, 
            so NGC 3172 essentially marked the pole position! John Herschel&#146;s 
            nickname &#147;Polarissima Borealis&#148; was certainly appropriate. 
            Since then precession has significantly altered its coordinates, so 
            the J2000 coordinates are 11h 47m 14s +89&deg; 05&#146; 32&#148;. 
            and currently (July 2018) the declination is just a hair less than 
            +89&deg;.</p>
          <p align="left">But is NGC 3172 actually the closest galaxy to the pole? 
            The answer depends on how faint you want to go. UGC 3211A is the northernmost 
            galaxy in the UGC (and original PGC) at a declination of +89&deg; 
            20&#146; (J2000). I couldn&#146;t find a reliable magnitude but it&#146;s 
            significantly fainter than NGC 3172 and I would guess the blue magnitude 
            of this low surface brightness dwarf is between mag 16 and 16.5. Unfortunately, 
            one of the major galaxy catalogues (MCG) made a 1 degree error in 
            reporting the declination and this error was copied into the PGC. 
            As a result, the galaxy is misplotted on Megastar one degree too far 
            south. If you&#146;re curious about the &#147;A&#148; designation, 
            this galaxy doesn&#146;t appear in the main UGC catalog but was added 
            in an addendum list of galaxies that were missed when the catalog 
            was compiled but found before the UGC went to print.</p>
          <p align="left">Even using a corrected Megastar chart, UGC 3211A was 
            a tough catch in my 24-inch and required some searching to notice 
            the galaxy. At 375x all I found was low surface brightness glow, perhaps 
            15&#148; diameter, which required averted vision. Examining its DSS 
            image later, I see I only picked up the brighter core . But once it 
            was locked down in the center of the eyepiece field, it was held ~80% 
            of the time with averted vision at 375x. By the way Polaris is 40&#146; 
            to the west (of course cardinal directions are somewhat meaningless 
            this close to the north celestial pole) so can be used to easily to 
            easily star hop over to the galaxy. I didn&#146;t have good transparency 
            at the time of the observation (observing through thin clouds at best), 
            but I would guess an 18-inch would be required to pick up this galaxy.</p>
          <p align="left">The southern hemisphere has its own &#147;Pole Galaxy&#148; 
            &#151; NGC 2573, which Herschel dubbed &#147;Polarissima Australis&#148;. 
            When discovered at Cape Town, South Africa in 1837, NGC 2573 was within 
            25&#146; of the south celestial pole and 50 years later that separation 
            had shrunk to 17&#146;. Since then precession has moved it away from 
            the pole (more accurately the pole has moved away from the galaxy) 
            but it is still within 45&#146;. And as a bonus, nearby are a pair 
            of colliding galaxies &#151; NGC 2573A and 2573B &#151; also within 
            a degree of the south celestial pole. A trip to the southern hemisphere 
            is a prerequisite to see these.</p>

          <p align="left">This galaxy group is located in a rich star field just 
            7&#146; N of 16 Cygni, a bright wide double star of mag 6.3/6.4 stars 
            at 39&#148; separation (split in 10x50 binoculars)! At 375x UGC 11465 
            appeared moderately bright, fairly small, round, well concentrated 
            with a bright core that gradually increased to the center. Very near 
            are CGCG 257-007 = PGC 63534 2.3' SSE, PGC 63531 just off the southeast 
            side [50&quot; from center] and PGC 63532 just off the NNE edge [38&quot; 
            from center] . UGC 11465 and CGCG 257-007 form the double radio source 
            3C 402.</p>
          <p align="left">PGC 63531: faint, extremely small, round, 10&quot; diameter 
            (375x).<br>
            PGC 63532: only occasionally popped as extremely faint and small (500x).<br>

          <p align="left">The galaxy group's location is not far from the Milky 
            Way&#146;s &#147;Zone of Avoidance&#148;. But there appears to be 
            little visual extinction here due to dust (clear window) as UGC 11465 
            was relatively prominent at a distance of roughly 350 million light 
            years. By the way, the separation of 16 Cygni is quite close to that 
            of Albireo, but is an easier split in binoculars due to its similar 
            magnitudes. <br>

          <p align="left">Hickson 73 consists of a relatively bright spiral (face-on 
            NGC 5829) and several fainter companions with higher redshifts. Only 
            three of Hickson&#146;s five galaxies (including IC 4526 = HCG 73B 
            and 73C) have similar redshifts, so this group is really only a physical 
            triplet. In Edwin Hubble's 1920 published version of his PhD dissertation 
            &quot;Photographic Investigations of Faint Nebulae&quot;, he noted 
            &quot;IC 4526 is connected to NGC 5829. The two form a double nebula 
            fashioned as a miniature of Messier 51.&#148; That bridge is illusionary, 
            though, as IC 4526 lies far in the background (redshift over twice 
            that of NGC 5829) and there is no physical connection.</p>
          <p align="left">NGC 5829 appeared moderately bright, irregularly round, 
            very small brighter core, low surface brightness halo, ~0.8'x0.6'. 
            A mag 12.4 star is 1.2' W, a mag 14.5 star 1.3' ESE and a mag 16.2 
            star is 1.3' NE. Two other members of HCG 73 were visible; IC 4526 
            = HCG 73B at 1.4&#146; NW (the pair forms Arp 42 = VV 7) and HCG 73C 
            2.4' NE. IC 4526 appeared faint, small, elongated 2:1 ~N-S, 20&#148;x10&#148; 
            while HCG 73C appeared extremely faint and small, 10&quot; diameter. 
            The mag 16.2 star is at the midpoint of NGC 5829 and HCG 73C.<br>

            nearly even surface brightness with only a slightly brighter core. 
            A mag 14.3 star is 40&quot; NNE of center.</p>
          <p align="left">William Herschel discovered this galaxy on Apr 17th, 
            1789 and called it &#147;considerably faint, small, elongated.&#148; 
            He missed the fainter companion, PGC 50803 = MCG +10-20-084, which 
            is just a half and arc minute west of center! It appeared very faint, 
            round, 12&quot; diameter. The &#147;companion&#148; actually lies 
            far in the background (5.7 times the distance) at 540 million l.y., 
            so once again this duo are an unrelated line of sight pair and the 
            image shows no sign at all of any interaction.<br>

            on this SDSS image. Here we really do have a messed up version of 
            M51, though the main galaxy may itself be a merger! NGC 5759 was logged 
            as fairly faint, irregularly round, bright core is offset to the southeast 
            side and a faint halo that extends only northwest of the core! The 
            companion attached to the tidal bridge is LEDA 200319, just 45&quot; 
            NNW. It was a very faint, round glow, only 5&quot; diameter, and could 
            just be held continuously with averted vision. A mag 15.2 star is 
            45&quot; N. There was no sign of the connecting bridge. CGCG 076-042, 
            situated 3.4&#146; S (outside the frame of this image), appeared faint, 
            small, elongated 3:2 or 2:1 SSW-NNE, ~25&quot;x15&quot;, very small

            was visible just off the west edge. LEDA 200339, an overlapping companion,

            NGC 6500 and 6501 are two similar bright galaxies though otherwise 
            visually unremarkable. But they form the base of a thin isosceles 
            triangle with a gorgeous double star at the vertex &#151; STF 2245 
            = 7.4/7.5 pair at 2.6&#148; separation (similar to the components 
            of the double-double). NGC 6500 appeared bright, moderately large, 
            elongated 3:2 SW-NE, well concentrated with a prominent core and small 
            intense nucleus, much fainter halo. NGC 6501 was quite similar, though 
            not quite as elongated. Once again the pair is a William Herschel 
            discovery on 29 Jun 1799, within the last few years of his active 
            observing career.</p>
          <p align="left">For an extreme challenge, there is a tiny galaxy (MAC 
            1756+1820) less than 1&#146; N of the bright double star. Furthermore, 
            the galaxy has a low surface brightness and the best I could do was 
            get an occasionally pop as a very diffuse hazy spot. Even then it 
            was difficult to confirm due to the bright pair.<br>

            broad, or 55&quot;; considerably hazy, or rather indistinctly terminated 
            at the borders, but not a brighter middle; a star mag 6-7 precedes 
            it, just 1 diameter of the field and nearly in the parallel [this 
            is probably HD 166197].&#148; But the previous year James Dunlop, 
            observing near Sydney with a hand-made 9-inch speculum reflector, 
            found a &quot;faint nebula, about 1 1/4' long and 30&quot; or 40&quot; 
            broad, with a considerable brightness near each end and faint in the 
            middle, resembling two small nebulae joined.&#148; That sounds fairly 
            similar to Herschel's, although his position was off by over a half-degree.<br>

            otherwise I suppose I might see the stars in it.&#148; His comment 
            &#147;easily resolvable&#148; had a different meaning than observers

            small, elongated 3:2 or 5:3 NW-SE, 20&quot;x14&#148;. The eastern 
            component had a faint stellar nucleus, but the fainter northwest component 
            (UGC 10987 NED2) was not separately resolved. A faint galaxy 30&#148;

          <p align="left">Although this was the fourth time I&#146;ve observed 
            this fascinating UGC triplet (look at the stretched tidal arms on 
            UGC 11798!), I had a terribly difficult time tracking down these low 
            surface brightness interacting galaxies, as they are hiding in a rich 
            Cygnus star field! Finally when I was about to give up, Jimi identified 
            the main triplet using 375x.</p>
          <p align="left">UGC 11797 was very faint, fairly small, very thin edge-on 
            5:1 or 6:1 E-W, 0.7'x0.1', very low even surface brightness. Situated 
            just 2.2' E of a mag 8.5 star (which was annoyingly bright)<br>
            UGC 11798 was faint, moderately large, very elongated 7:2 NW-SE, 0.8'x0.25', 
            low nearly even surface brightness. <br>
            UGC 11801, the brightest of the triplet, was fairly faint, elongated 
            ~3:2 SW-NE, low surface brightness, irregular but no distinct core. 
            A very faint star is at the NE end.<br>
            PGC 67244 was very tough and only glimpsed as an extremely small puff 
            of smoke.</p>

          <p align="left">Again this is the fourth time I&#146;ve taken a look 
            at this photogenic interacting pair with a pair of amazing tidal arms. 
            VV 289a is the brighter and larger member of the pair and was easily 
            seen as a fairly faint, fairly small glow, elongated 5:3 ~E-W, ~25&quot;x15&quot;, 
            faint stellar nucleus. A dim 16th magnitude star is at the east edge. 
            The tidal plume to the northwest was not seen with confidence though 
            haze was suspected. VV 289b, 0.7' ESE of center, appeared faint, very 
            small, slightly elongated, 15&quot;x12&quot;, faint stellar nucleus. 
            Slightly brighter LEDA 2212393 just 1.6' NE appeared fairly faint, 
            small, round, 15&quot; diameter, slightly brighter stellar nucleus. 
            It has a higher surface brightness than VV 289b.</p>
