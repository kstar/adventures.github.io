          <p align="left">This is the second part of my observing report from a trip to Grandview campground in the White Mountains on August 30 to Sept 3 2016. We were fortunate to observe
          under 4 consecutive clear, transparent nights at 8600 ft with SQM-L readings in the 21.70 - 21.82 range. This photo was taken at a view point just up the White Mountain road from
          the campground. Besides the stunning vistas of the eastern Sierras, it’s the only nearby location to get a reliable cell signal, so we also jokingly call it the cell phone lot.</p>

          The following observations are from Thursday and Friday (Sep 1 and 2) nights with my 24-inch f/3.7 Starmaster (photo above at campground). I left on Saturday for the long drive back
          to the San Francisco area but Jimi Lowrey mentioned to me that Saturday night, which as looking very iffy when I left, was also clear.</p>

          <p align="left">UGC 12281 is a superthin galaxy - a classification <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1981ApJ...250...79G">introduced in 1981</a> by astronomers Jean Goad and
          Morton Roberts. These very late-type spiral (Sc or Sd) are bulgeless galaxies seen perfectly edge-on have axial ratios from 9:1 to 20:1 Typically they have very low surface
          brightness, which also implies a low star formation rate. But UGC 12281 is a bit of an enigma as a it has a remarkable amount of current star formation. <a href=
          "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.2538v1.pdf">A recent study</a> suggests an interaction with a nearby dwarf companion may have triggered this result.</p>
          <p>UGC 12281 is also one of the thinnest galaxies in the Flat Galaxy Catalogue (FGC) with an axial ratio of 17 to 1! At 220x it appeared extremely to very faint; extremely thin
          streak ~1.5'x0.1' SW-NE, slightly brighter center. Could nearly hold steadily with averted and concentration. A mag 14.2 star is just west of the southwest end. A mag 13.2 star is
          1.1' W of center. I had previously observed this galaxy with my 18” Starmaster from the Bumpass Hell parking lot at Lassen Volcanic National Park.</p>

          <p align="left">This starburst galaxy or possible interacting pair is located in Lacerta less than 1’ NW of a mag 10.9 star! At 200x it appeared moderately bright, elongated 5:2
          N-S, 0.7'x0.3', bright core. A small, very faint knot or extension is at the north end. A mag 10.9 star is 0.9' SE of center. At 375x; the "knot" attached on the west side of north
          end of the galaxy extends ~20"x10" NNW-SSE (slightly different PA than the main galaxy), increasing the total size of the merged glow to nearly 1.0'x0.3'. HyperLeda catalogues the
          object at the north end separately as a galaxy (<x-dso>PGC 214816</x-dso>), though on the SDSS it appears to be a collection of blue (star-forming) knots. While in the area check out <x-dso>NGC 7248</x-dso>,
          which is located 17' WSW.</p>

          <p align="left">This Saturn look-alike resides in Aquarius at a distance of ~340 million l.y. The classification is a Polar Ring (PRG), a rare type of galaxy with an early type disc
          galaxy (S0 or Sa) surrounded by a bluish ring of stars, gas and dust orbiting perpendicular to the disc. The formation process is not fully understood but probably involves the
          interaction of two galaxies.</p>
          <p>At 220x and 375x, I immediately picked up the central (host) galaxy of this Polar Ring galaxy as a very faint, round glow, only ~8" diameter. Occasionally the (blue) polar ring
          component was seen as extremely faint and thin extensions SW-NE, increasing the dimensions to ~20"x8". Located 9' SW of mag 7.9 <x-dso>HD 198153</x-dso> and 18' SE of the bright pair NGC

          <x-dso>LEDA 1631504</x-dso>, the western component was extremely faint and small, round, 8" diameter. This was the faintest in the triplet and it took some effort to detect. <x-dso>LEDA 1631594</x-dso>, just 22"
          NE, was the brightest of the triplet. It was easily visible as a faint, very small, round glow, 15" diameter, containing a faint stellar nucleus. 2MASX J01301684+2035423, on the
          east side, was very faint, extremely small, round, 8" diameter. A mag 13.4 star is 1.4' NW of the trio. You can see German amateur Uwe Glahn's sketch with his 27-inch at 419x

          which is only based on appearance and likely not a physical description. Whatever is going on with this galaxy, it is apparently disturbed by nearby <x-dso>LEDA 913872</x-dso>. Here is <a href=

          913872 just 30" W. At 375x an extremely faint and small glow, ~8" diameter, was visible over 50% of the time once noticed with averted vision. Forms a (physical) triplet with MCG

          <p>This galaxy is easily the brightest galaxy (cD-type) in <x-dso simbad="ACO 2589">AGC 2589</x-dso>, a richness class 0 cluster at a distance of ~560 million l.y. Surrounding NGC 7647 is a large swarm of very

          <p>NGC 7647 was discovered by William Herschel with his 18.7-inch speculum reflector November 29 1785. On his 480th sweep, he recorded “extremely faint, considerably large, some
          doubt left. It precedes an irregular row of scattered stars.” He missed the faint companions in the cluster.</p>

          star-forming region, part of the <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/313076/fulltext/">Cepheus Flare giant molecular cloud complex</a>, contains a number of low-mass
          YSOs. At 124x (49' field) a very large starless region is centered roughly 8' SW of the 5.8-magnitude star. On images this obscured region extends roughly 45'x15' E-W. In 1995 UGC
          12160 was the host of the core-collapse supernova 1995X.</p>
          <p>Using 200x UGC 12160 was easily picked up as a fairly faint, moderately large glow, elongated 4:3 ~N-S, 0.8'x0.6', diffuse, weak concentration. Based on the DSS, I picked up the

          <p align="left">NGC 7603 is a bright Seyfert 1 galaxy. Halton Arp first mentioned a redshift anomaly with this pair in ApL, 7, 221, 1971 (not available online). NGC 7603, the
          brighter galaxy, has a redshift z = .029 (~390 million ly) while its companion <x-dso>NGC 7603B</x-dso> has a much higher redshift z = .057, placing it about twice the distance (~740 million ly).
          But there is an apparent luminous bridge connecting the objects that is easily visible on the DSS. Also two quasars with much higher redshifts (z = .391 and z = .243) are embedded
          exactly on line of sight at the start and end of the bridge. The controversy is discussed in detail on page 84-87 of the Arp Atlas by Kanipe and Webb and a detailed online analysis
          is <a href="https://arijmaki.wordpress.com/2010/04/10/ngc-7603-the-discordant-redshift-system/">here</a>.</p>
          <p align="left">NGC 7603 appeared bright, small, round, contains a very small unusually bright core that increases to an extremely bright stellar nucleus! Forms a close (line of
          sight) pair with NGC 7603B 1.0' SE. The companion appeared extremely to very faint, extremely small, only ~6" diameter, required averted vision (V = 15.9, B = 16.7). I didn’t see

          <p align="left">Arp placed this galaxy in his category "Concentric Ring Galaxies.” These rings are not the dust features in the main disk, but very low surface brightness features
          in the outer halo. Arp’s image with the 200-inch is <a href="http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Arp/Figures/big_arp231.jpeg">here</a> These type of galaxies are known today as
          “Shell galaxies” and these features are thought to result from the interaction of two galaxies. On the DSS and SDSS, IC 1575 appears to be a post-merger system with a prominent
          curving dust slicing the galaxy from SW to NE and low surface brightness outer arcs or shells. The NW portion of the system contains the bright nucleus and is listed in NED as IC
          1575A = MCG -01-03-002 and the larger SE portion is <x-dso>IC 1575B</x-dso> = MCG -01-03-003.</p>
          <p>With 322x the glow is fairly faint, irregularly round, ~25" diameter. A mag 13.3 star is 0.6' S. At the northwest side is a brighter quasi-stellar knot or nucleus of IC
