Simeis 147 is a gigantic supernova remnant in Taurus, comparable in apparent size to the Veil Nebula in Lyra, but much fainter. Steve Coe calls it "the Veil in a 2-inch scope." Although it's usually easier to detect faint deep sky objects if you know exactly where to look,  you never know what you might find by sweeping the area ESE of Beta Tauri, the northern horn of the bull.  Based upon the observing reports, you may wish to begin with Regions A & B<p>

<i>The first area observed was around star SAO 77322, where a large, well-defined streak extended 15' to the east. Other knots and streaks

were observed near and south of SAO 77350.</i> - Rich Jakiel<br>

<i>Two arcs, one at SAO 77322, the other about 15' south were easily [!] visible.  Much like the Veil, the arcs could be followed for approximately

two degrees around the periphery of the object.</i> - Gil Shillcutt<p>

<i>The most amazing and intricate region of the entire SNR, this is an interwoven tapestry of filaments and nebulous arcs against a beautiful starry background. In one sector, several filaments were visible criss-crossing each other at nearly right angles!</i> - Rich Jakiel.<p>



<B><font size=5><A HREF="s147pix.htm">Region C</A></font></B>   ~05 39 +29 07<br>

Thin trail of wisps and tendrils running ENE - WSW between SAO 77354 (mag 6.0) and  SAO 77381 (mag 7.0).<br>

<i>Faint nebulous arcs and patches were visible in regions 'D' and 'C'. Around C, some secondary details were visible, though not nearly as richly complex as in region B.</i> - Rich Jakiel<p> 



<B><font size=5><A HREF="s147pix.htm">Region D</A></font></B>   ~05 43 +28 17<br>

Nebulous patch about 30' SE of SAO 77397 (mag 8.1) in a loose clump of stars.<br>

<i>A "clump" of ~8-12 sparse stars of ~10th magnitude and fainter ~10' in diameter was easily visible, resembling an OC of sorts. Faint hints of nebulosity were apparent surrounding the entire "clump". When the scope was moved ~1 fov in the N/S direction, the nebulosity became a diffuse glow with definite edges some 10'x15' in size and oriented in an E/W direction.  Averted vision was not continuously required for this.</i> - Jay McNeil<p>
