          It looked like the November new moon window for observing was going 
          to be lost due to clouds and rain, but the weather cleared up on Monday 
          the 24th and you have to take advantage of these opportunities if you 
          want to observe this time of year. So, I arranged to meet Carter Scholz 
          and Bob Douglas at Lake Sonoma. The weekday afternoon drive north up 
          101 was a bit slow, but I arrived before sunset to find Bob in the process 
          of setting up his 28-inch f/3.6 reflector under a perfectly clear sky. 
          Carter arrived a bit later and very quickly set up his homemade 16-inch 
          reflector. My 24-inch f/3.7 Starstructure completed the collection of 
          large glass.</p>
        <p>With sunset now before 5:00, astronomical twilight ended by 6:30 and 
          a thin crescent moon set shortly afterwards. With the early nightfall, 
          I was able to quit by 1:40 and still observe a full 7 hours! Conditions 
          stayed clear, calm and cool, with pretty good seeing and variable transparency. 
          The only issue we had was dew started forming after midnight and started 
          to make things a bit moist.</p>
        <p>One small project I've started is to reobserve NGC galaxies that have 
          faint companions, which were previously not seen in my smaller scopes. 
          NGC 161, NGC 262, NGC 931 and NGC 7704 all met this criteria, and all 
          revealed their dim neighbors. In the past, I've spent a great deal of 
          eyepiece time identifying dozens of globulars, clusters and OB associations 
          in M31. I added a couple of new members of the M31 contingent, which 
          are highlighted below. Unless noted otherwise, all observations were 
          made at 200x and 375x (13mm Ethos to identify the object and 6mm Delos 
          to look for details).</p>

            NGC 161 and IC 1557<br>
            00 35 33.8 -02 50 55<br>
            Size: 1.3'x0.7'; Mag: V = 13.2</p>
          <p align="left">NGC 161 is fairly faint, fairly small, oval 4:3 SSW-NNE, 
            fairly high surface brightness. It contains a small bright nucleus 
            that increases to a stellar point. A mag 12 star is 1.2' N and a mag 
            12.5 star is 2' SSW. Located 6' SE of mag 8.8 HD 3205. IC 1557, just 
            1.7' S, is faint, very small, round, 12&quot; diameter.</p>
          <p align="left">Lewis Swift discovered NGC 161 in the fall of 1886 with 
            the 16&quot; refractor at the Warner Observatory in Rochester, N.Y., 
            but missed IC 1557. Herbert Howe discovered IC 1557 in 1899, using 
            the 20-inch refractor at the Chamberlin Observatory in Denver. Most 
            modern sources incorrectly equate NGC 161 with IC 1557.</p>

            00 48 47.1 +31 57 25<br>
            Size: 1.1'x1.1'; Mag: V = 13.1</p>
          <p align="left">NGC 262 is moderately bright, small, round, dominated 
            by a high surface brightness core that increases to the center, very 
            low surface brightness halo, ~25&quot; diameter. LEDA 212600 is just 
            1.2' E and appeared very faint, very small, round, 10&quot; diameter, 
            too faint (V = 15.4) for any details.</p>
          <p align="left">Lewis Swift discovered NGC 262 in September 1885 at 
            the Warner Observatory, though he missed the companion just east. 
            As of January 1991, this Sy2 galaxy, which resides at a distance of 
            ~200 million light years, was the second largest known galaxy, spanning 
            1.3 million l.y. (S&amp;T: July 1987, page 9). A large H I halo may 
            have been produced by the interaction of NGC 262 and NGC 266 (Heckman 
            et al 1982 and Simkin et al 1987). Swift missed the faint companion 
            to the east with his 16-inch refractor.</p>

            Size: ~15&quot;</p>
          <p align="left">This giant HII complex in M31 appeared faint, small, 
            elongated 3:2 or 5:3 NW-SE, ~15&quot;x10&quot;. A few times a stellar 
            point was noticed at the edge. On the SDSS there is a mag 16.5 star 
            (probably foreground) just 12&quot; south. Located 13.5' W of the 
            center of M32. Walter Baade and Halton Arp first catalogued this object 
            as an HII region (#289) in their 1964 paper &quot;Positions of emission 
            nebulae in M 31&quot; (ApJ, 139, 1027).<br>

            00 46 31.8 +42 12 25</p>
          <p align="left">This OB association in M31 is situated at the extreme 
            northeast end of the galaxy, 1.2&deg; from the center. At 200x, three 
            HII complexes in a NW-SE string could be detected. C372/373 at the 
            southeast end is the brightest and appeared faint, small, round, ~12&quot; 
            diameter, slightly brighter stellar point at center. On the SDSS, 
            C372/373 this is a group of several HII complexes and I was probably 
            picking up the combined glow of the two northern knots. Just 1' NW 
            and 2' NW are fainter C378 and C381. C378 was extremely faint and 
            small, round, 8&quot; diameter, only occasionally popped. C381 was 
            initially seen fairly easily at 200x, forming the southwest vertex 
            of an equilateral triangle with two mag 11/12 star. But then I had 
            a difficult time reacquiring the small, extremely faint 8&quot; glow.<br>

            Size: 2.5'x0.7'; Mag: V = 12.7</p>
          <p align="left">NGC 523 = Arp 158 appeared fairly bright, moderately 
            bright, very elongated 7:2 ~E-W, ~1.1'x0.3'. This disrupted galaxy 
            (or merger) appeared very asymmetric, widening a bit at the east end 
            and tapering slightly to the west. A small, relatively bright knot 
            (HII complex or core of companion?), ~10&quot; diameter, is at the 
            east end. An easily visible mag 14-14.5 star is embedded at the west 
            end. The main body, which extends ~40&quot; from the knot to the star, 
            is fairly thin and only very weakly brighter in the center. With careful 
            viewing, a very faint narrow plume extends west of the main glow.</p>
          <p align="left">Heinrich d'Arrest, observing in 1862 with the 11-inch 
            refractor in Copenhagen, noted &quot;Double Nebula, F, S, both very 
            near&quot;. Although Dreyer only assigned a single NGC number, d'Arrest 
            apparently resolved the knot at the east end.<br>

          <p align="left">NGC 777 is bright, moderately large, elongated 4:3 NNW-SSE, 
            sharply concentrated with a very bright rounder core, ~0.9'x0.7'. 
            Two fairly bright stars are in the field to the south, mag 9.3 SAO 
            55174 lies 5' SW and mag 8.7 SAO 55185 is 6.4' SE. NGC 778 lies 7' 
            SSE and was logged as moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 3:2 
            NNW-SSE, ~30&quot;x20&quot;, weak concentration. A mag 8.7 star is 
            3' NE. KUG 0156+310 = PGC 74060 is 6' W and is an extremely faint 
            8&quot; glow just north of a mag 13-13.5 star.</p>
          <p align="left">William Herschel discovered NGC 777 on 12 Sep 1784, 
            but missed (as well as John Herschel) NGC 778. Truman Safford found 
            NGC 7787 in 1866 with the 18&quot; refractor at the Dearborn Observatory. 
            The KUG was first catalogued in 1991 during the &quot;Kiso survey 
            for ultraviolet-excess galaxies&quot;.</p>

            Size: 3.9'x0.8'; Mag: V= 12.8</p>
          <p align="left">NGC 931 is moderately bright and large, thin edge-on 
            5:1 WSW-ENE, 1.5'x0.3', brighter core, sharp stellar nucleus. LEDA 
            212995, a very close (physical) companion, is at the north edge just 
            18&quot; from center. At 375x, it was seen as an extremely faint and 
            small glow, ~6&quot; diameter.</p>
          <p align="left">Heinrich d'Arrest discovered NGC 931 (a Seyfert galaxy) 
            in 1865 with the 11-inch refractor at Copenhagen, but of course missed 
            the faint companion. LEDA 212995 was not catalogued by the various 
            galaxy surveys in the 1960's and 1970's that were based on the POSS. 
            I'm guessing a 16-inch will be necessary to clearly identify the companion.</p>

            NGC 7492<br>
            23 08 26.6 -15 36 41<br>
            Size: 4.2' ; Mag: V = 11.5</p>
          <p align="left">This class XII Globular (lowest concentration class) 
            was picked up at 200x as a faint, large, low surface brightness glow 
            with a very weak concentration, 4'-5' diameter. At 375x, a few resolved 
            stars shine steadily and quite a number pop in/out view consistently. 
            Perhaps two dozen are intermittently resolved, though too lively (particularly 
            with averted vision) to count reliably. These are the brightest red 
            giant members and range from mag 15.5 to 16+.</p>
          <p align="left">William Herschel, who discovered NGC 7492 in 1786, described 
            this cluster as &quot;eF, cL, iR. By changing and wiping the eye glasses, 
            I saw it with both so as to leave no doubt. 5 or 6' dia.&quot; John 
            Herschel also found it &quot;eF; vL; 2 or 3'; the faintest thing imaginable.&quot; 
            NGC 7492 is certainly among the faintest NGC globulars -- at least 
            in terms of surface brightness -- though NGC 6380 and NGC 6479 are 
            more challenging.</p>

          <p>This Pisces trio fits in a 5' circle. At 375x, UGC 12547 appeared 
            fairly faint, fairly small, slightly elongated N-S, low and fairly 
            even surface brightness. The outer portions of the spiral arms were 
            not picked up. UGC 12548, just 2.4' NE, is fairly faint, moderately
