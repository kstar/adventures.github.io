        <p>On Sunday, December 1st, Bob Douglas and I decided to take a chance 
          on observing at Lake Sonoma, northwest of Healdsburg in Sonoma County. 
          Weather conditions looked pretty iffy in the afternoon, with a huge 
          bank of clouds right along the coast that seemed to be pushing inland. 
          The Sunday afternoon traffic driving north on 101 past Santa Rosa and 
          into the Sonoma vineyards was very light, and the ride took less than 
          90 minutes from Albany. When I pulled into the Lone Rock lot about 20 
          minutes before sunset, I found that Bob had arrived quite a bit earlier, 
          but had decided to wait before setting up his 28-inch scope as the conditions 
          looked pretty bleak. Even as the sky darkened after sunset, there was 
          no significant improvement, though I decided to go ahead and set up 
          my 24-inch Starstructure dob as I preferred to do that before it was 
          dark.</p>
        <p>By the time astronomical twilight ended (~6:30) much of the sky had 
          cleared and by 7:00 PM we were astonished to find nearly perfectly clear 
          skies. Bob quickly set his large scope up and spent the evening giving 
          a private sky tour to a former colleague from San Francisco State University. 
          We both observed from roughly 7:00 to 12:30 and although we quit relatively 
          early, I was surprised to have logged over 50 objects, mostly trios, 
          interacting pair and small groups of galaxies. Conditions were pretty 
          good -- SQM-L readings were in the 21.3-21.4 range, which is pretty 
          typical of Lake Sonoma (blue/green light pollution zone), there was 
          no wind or dew and what had earlier looked like a futile attempt to 
          observe turned into an excellent night!</p>
        <p>The following observations were made with my 24-inch Starstructure, 
          equipped with a Servocat drive and ArgoNavis DSCs. Typically, objects 
          were found using either a 21mm Ethos (124x) or a 13mm Ethos (200x), 
          but then observed for details with a 6mm Delos (375x). Seeing was not 
          steady enough to support higher power. All images are from the Sloan 
          Digital Sky Survey (<a href="http://www.sdss.org/">http://www.sdss.org/</a>) 
          except for the southern triple KTS 22, which is from the <a href="www.wikisky.org/">www.wikisky.org/</a>. 
          The Vorontsov-Velyaminov Catalogue of Interacting Galaxies is available 
          from Alvin Huey as an observing guide at <a href="http://faintfuzzies.com/DownloadableObservingGuides2.html">http://faintfuzzies.com/DownloadableObservingGuides2.html</a>.</p>

        <p>VV 176a appeared fairly faint, small, round, 18&quot; diameter. A mag 
          14.5-15 star lies 42&quot; SE. VV 176 is a tight double system (15&quot; 
          separation) and at 375x VV 176b occasionally &quot;popped&quot; as an 
          extremely faint &quot;star&quot; on the SE edge. VV 176 = UGC 1191 is 
          the brightest member of AGC 240 (distance ~800 million l.y.) with VV 
          177 = MCG +01-05-022 just 0.9' SW and PGC 97368 1.9' NW. VV 177 was 
          a very faint glow, very small, round, 15&quot; diameter. A mag 16.4v 
          companion at the SW edge was not seen. PGC 97368 was extremely faint, 
          round, 8&quot; diameter. I also picked up PGC 3623196 further southwest 
          in the cluster, which was slightly brighter than PGC 97368 and a similar 
          size.</p>

          2.7' diameter</p>
        <p>VV 305a = CGCG 454-059 is the brightest and the northwest component 
          of VV 305, an interacting triplet extending 2.7' NW to SE. At 375x it 
          appeared fairly faint, small, round, 24&quot; diameter. A mag 14 star 
          lies 1.2' W and a mag 9.8 star is 3' S. VV 305a is a face-on barred 
          spiral with a faint tidal tail extending NW and a connecting arm towards 
          VV 305b, just 55&quot; ESE. VV 305b appeared very faint, very small, 
          round, 12&quot; diameter. VV 305c = UGC 12574, situated 2.4' NE of the 
          mag 9.8star and 2.7' SE of brighter VV 305a, appeared faint, fairly 
          small, elongated 2:1 or 5:2 E-W, ~28&quot;x12&quot;, even surface brightness. 
          I had the impression that the brighter portion was a bar embedded in 
          an extremely faint halo. On the SDSS image, VV 305c was confirmed to 
          be a barred spiral with a stretched tidal arm on the east end extending 
          SW, perhaps from interaction with VV 305a and/or VV 305b. Both VV 305a 
          and VV 305c have identical redshifts of z = .04 (~500 million l.y.).</p>

          1.0' diameter</p>
        <p>At 260x, the elliptical companion to the west (right) was easily visible 
          as a fairly faint, small round glow, 15&quot; diameter, with an even 
          surface brightness. Forms a close pair with UGC 1095, just 1' E. Only 
          the core of UGC 1095 was occasionally visible as an extremely faint, 
          very small, round, 10&quot; glow with a mag 13.8 star nearly attached 
          on the south side [20&quot; from center]. The very low surface brightness 
          tidal arms (one extends directly west to MCG +05-04-066) were not visible. 
          This pair is in Arp's category of &quot;elliptical companion on arm

        <p>Using 375x and 500x, the northeast component of VIII Zw 20 appeared 
          extremely faint, very small, ~15&quot; diameter. Situated 0.8' NE of 
          a mag 12.3 star. On the SDSS image, this galaxy is the brighter member 
          of an interacting pair and has long tidal plume to the SE and as well 
          as a very low surface brightness plume to the west. A very small companion 
          is just 35&quot; WNW. I probably picked up the companion (logged as 
          &quot;very faint, extremely small, round, 6&quot; diameter&quot;) or 
          possibly a 16th magnitude star which is 24&quot; further north. Located

          This quintet contains five NGC galaxies, four with similar redshifts 
          (NGC 7547/7549/7550/7553) and one (NGC 7558) which is likely a background 
          object. NGC 7550 = 93A, the brightest member, was discovered by William 
          Herschel in 1784. It appeared fairly bright, moderately large, irregularly 
          round, 1.0'x0.8', strongly concentrated with a bright core that increases 
          to a very bright small nucleus. Occasionally, a bright stellar nuclear 
          pip was visible within the small nucleus. NGC 7547 = 93C, just 3.1' 
          WNW, was missed by William but discovered by his son John in 1827. It 
          appeared fairly faint, moderately large, elongated 5:2 ~E-W, strongly 
          concentrated with a nearly round, small bright core. On the north side 
          is NGC 7549 = 93B, a moderately bright glow, elongated 3:2 N-S, ~60&quot;x40&quot;. 
          Contains a brighter central region with only a weak, broad concentration 
          towards the center. A mag 11 star lies 1.4' WNW of center. NGC 7553 
          = 93D is 3.8' ENE of NGC 7549 and is fairly faint, small, round, 20&quot; 
          diameter. Contains a faint, quasi-stellar nucleus. PGC and Megastar 
          only identify this galaxy as CGCG 454-15. Finally, NGC 7558 = 93E on 
          the SE side of the group is fairly faint, small, round, 20&quot; diameter, 
          weak concentration. Nearly collinear with two mag 14.5 stars [22&quot; 
          separation] located ~2.8' S. </p>

          This triplet consists of two IC galaxies (1583 and 1585), which were 
          discovered visually in November of 1897 by Stephane Javelle using the 
          30-inch f/23 refractor at the Nice observatory in France. He missed 
          the much fainter third component MCG +04-03-003. IC 1585 appeared fairly 
          faint, very small, round, 18&quot; diameter, contains a very small very 
          bright nucleus. This compact galaxy has a very high surface brightness. 
          IC 1583 (just 1.5' NW) was just slightly fainter, very small, slightly 
          elongated, 18&quot;x15&quot;, contains a very small bright nucleus, 
          high surface brightness. Finally, MCG +04-03-003 1.2' ESE, was extremely 
          faint, very small, ~10&quot; diameter. Required averted vision and was 
          only visible part of the time.</p>

          3' diameter</p>
        <p>This little trio has problems with the IC identifications. UGC 978, 
          the faintest member, is misidentified as IC 107 in the UGC, HyperLeda, 
          Megastar and Uranometria 2000.0. It appeared faint, small, slightly 
          elongated ~E-W, weak concentration, overall low surface brightness (Sc 
          face-on). Situated 3.6' ENE of a mag 10 star (bright red star in the 
          SDSS image). IC 1698, an inclined spiral, is moderately bright, fairly 
          small, elongated 2:1 WNW-ESE, 0.6'x0.3', small bright core. IC 1699 
          is probably a duplicate observation of this same galaxy. IC 107 = IC 
          1700, the brightest in the triplet, was discovered by both Lewis Swift 
          in 1890 and independently by Stephane Javelle in 1896. Stephane assumed 
          it was a new discovery as Swift's position was poor. This fairly bright 
          glow was small, round, 20&quot;, high surface brightness. Gradually 
          increases towards the center, then a sharp stellar nucleus. A mag 14.5 
          star is at the SW edge.</p>
