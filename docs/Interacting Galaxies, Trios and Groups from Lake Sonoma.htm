          <p>On Sunday, December 1st, Bob Douglas and I decided to take a chance on observing at Lake Sonoma, northwest of Healdsburg in Sonoma County. Weather conditions looked pretty iffy
          in the afternoon, with a huge bank of clouds right along the coast that seemed to be pushing inland. The Sunday afternoon traffic driving north on 101 past Santa Rosa and into the
          Sonoma vineyards was very light, and the ride took less than 90 minutes from Albany. When I pulled into the Lone Rock lot about 20 minutes before sunset, I found that Bob had
          arrived quite a bit earlier, but had decided to wait before setting up his 28-inch scope as the conditions looked pretty bleak. Even as the sky darkened after sunset, there was no
          significant improvement, though I decided to go ahead and set up my 24-inch Starstructure dob as I preferred to do that before it was dark.</p>
          <p>By the time astronomical twilight ended (~6:30) much of the sky had cleared and by 7:00 PM we were astonished to find nearly perfectly clear skies. Bob quickly set his large
          scope up and spent the evening giving a private sky tour to a former colleague from San Francisco State University. We both observed from roughly 7:00 to 12:30 and although we quit
          relatively early, I was surprised to have logged over 50 objects, mostly trios, interacting pair and small groups of galaxies. Conditions were pretty good -- SQM-L readings were in
          the 21.3-21.4 range, which is pretty typical of Lake Sonoma (blue/green light pollution zone), there was no wind or dew and what had earlier looked like a futile attempt to observe
          turned into an excellent night!</p>
          <p>The following observations were made with my 24-inch Starstructure, equipped with a Servocat drive and ArgoNavis DSCs. Typically, objects were found using either a 21mm Ethos
          (124x) or a 13mm Ethos (200x), but then observed for details with a 6mm Delos (375x). Seeing was not steady enough to support higher power. All images are from the Sloan Digital Sky
          Survey (<a href="http://www.sdss.org/">http://www.sdss.org/</a>) except for the southern triple KTS 22, which is from the <a href="https://www.wikisky.org/">www.wikisky.org/</a>. The
          Vorontsov-Velyaminov Catalogue of Interacting Galaxies is available from Alvin Huey as an observing guide at <a href=

          "popped" as an extremely faint "star" on the SE edge. VV 176 = UGC 1191 is the brightest member of AGC 240 (distance ~800 million l.y.) with VV 177 = MCG +01-05-022 just 0.9' SW and
          <x-dso>PGC 97368</x-dso> 1.9' NW. VV 177 was a very faint glow, very small, round, 15" diameter. A mag 16.4v companion at the SW edge was not seen. PGC 97368 was extremely faint, round, 8"
          diameter. I also picked up <x-dso>PGC 3623196</x-dso> further southwest in the cluster, which was slightly brighter than PGC 97368 and a similar size.</p>

          diameter. A mag 14 star lies 1.2' W and a mag 9.8 star is 3' S. VV 305a is a face-on barred spiral with a faint tidal tail extending NW and a connecting arm towards <x-dso>VV 305b</x-dso>, just
          55" ESE. VV 305b appeared very faint, very small, round, 12" diameter. <x-dso>VV 305c</x-dso> = UGC 12574, situated 2.4' NE of the mag 9.8star and 2.7' SE of brighter VV 305a, appeared faint,
          fairly small, elongated 2:1 or 5:2 E-W, ~28"x12", even surface brightness. I had the impression that the brighter portion was a bar embedded in an extremely faint halo. On the SDSS
          image, VV 305c was confirmed to be a barred spiral with a stretched tidal arm on the east end extending SW, perhaps from interaction with VV 305a and/or VV 305b. Both VV 305a and VV
          305c have identical redshifts of z = .04 (~500 million l.y.).</p>

          <p>At 260x, the elliptical companion to the west (right) was easily visible as a fairly faint, small round glow, 15" diameter, with an even surface brightness. Forms a close pair
          with <x-dso>UGC 1095</x-dso>, just 1' E. Only the core of UGC 1095 was occasionally visible as an extremely faint, very small, round, 10" glow with a mag 13.8 star nearly attached on the south
          side [20" from center]. The very low surface brightness tidal arms (one extends directly west to <x-dso>MCG +05-04-066</x-dso>) were not visible. This pair is in Arp's category of "elliptical
          companion on arm of spiral galaxy"</p>

          galaxy is the brighter member of an interacting pair and has long tidal plume to the SE and as well as a very low surface brightness plume to the west. A very small companion is
          just 35" WNW. I probably picked up the companion (logged as "very faint, extremely small, round, 6" diameter") or possibly a 16th magnitude star which is 24" further north. Located
          29' ESE of mag 3.5 Iota Ceti.</p>

          This quintet contains five NGC galaxies, four with similar redshifts (<x-dso>NGC 7547</x-dso>/7549/7550/7553) and one (<x-dso>NGC 7558</x-dso>) which is likely a background object. <x-dso>NGC 7550</x-dso> = 93A, the brightest
          member, was discovered by William Herschel in 1784. It appeared fairly bright, moderately large, irregularly round, 1.0'x0.8', strongly concentrated with a bright core that
          increases to a very bright small nucleus. Occasionally, a bright stellar nuclear pip was visible within the small nucleus. NGC 7547 = 93C, just 3.1' WNW, was missed by William but
          discovered by his son John in 1827. It appeared fairly faint, moderately large, elongated 5:2 ~E-W, strongly concentrated with a nearly round, small bright core. On the north side
          is <x-dso>NGC 7549</x-dso> = 93B, a moderately bright glow, elongated 3:2 N-S, ~60"x40". Contains a brighter central region with only a weak, broad concentration towards the center. A mag 11 star
          lies 1.4' WNW of center. <x-dso>NGC 7553</x-dso> = 93D is 3.8' ENE of NGC 7549 and is fairly faint, small, round, 20" diameter. Contains a faint, quasi-stellar nucleus. PGC and Megastar only
          identify this galaxy as <x-dso simbad="Z 454-15">CGCG 454-15</x-dso>. Finally, NGC 7558 = 93E on the SE side of the group is fairly faint, small, round, 20" diameter, weak concentration. Nearly collinear with two
          mag 14.5 stars [22" separation] located ~2.8' S.</p>

          This triplet consists of two IC galaxies (1583 and 1585), which were discovered visually in November of 1897 by Stephane Javelle using the 30-inch f/23 refractor at the Nice
          observatory in France. He missed the much fainter third component <x-dso>MCG +04-03-003</x-dso>. IC 1585 appeared fairly faint, very small, round, 18" diameter, contains a very small very bright
          nucleus. This compact galaxy has a very high surface brightness. <x-dso>IC 1583</x-dso> (just 1.5' NW) was just slightly fainter, very small, slightly elongated, 18"x15", contains a very small
          bright nucleus, high surface brightness. Finally, MCG +04-03-003 1.2' ESE, was extremely faint, very small, ~10" diameter. Required averted vision and was only visible part of the
          time.</p>

          <p>This little trio has problems with the IC identifications. <x-dso>UGC 978</x-dso>, the faintest member, is misidentified as IC 107 in the UGC, HyperLeda, Megastar and Uranometria 2000.0. It
          appeared faint, small, slightly elongated ~E-W, weak concentration, overall low surface brightness (Sc face-on). Situated 3.6' ENE of a mag 10 star (bright red star in the SDSS
          image). <x-dso>IC 1698</x-dso>, an inclined spiral, is moderately bright, fairly small, elongated 2:1 WNW-ESE, 0.6'x0.3', small bright core. <x-dso>IC 1699</x-dso> is probably a duplicate observation of this
          same galaxy. IC 107 = IC 1700, the brightest in the triplet, was discovered by both Lewis Swift in 1890 and independently by Stephane Javelle in 1896. Stephane assumed it was a new
          discovery as Swift's position was poor. This fairly bright glow was small, round, 20", high surface brightness. Gradually increases towards the center, then a sharp stellar nucleus.
          A mag 14.5 star is at the SW edge.</p>

          and orientation were difficult to gauge. A mag 15 star is 30" S and a mag 17.3 star was suspected just off the west end.</p>
