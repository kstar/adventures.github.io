17.5": surprisingly bright object with 20mm Nagler and an OIII filter! Appears as a very irregular,  fairly bright nebulosity involved or
illuminated by a mag 9 star (SAO 49801).  There is a sharply defined edge against a very dark background NE of the star and also S of the star.  The nebulosity is more ill-defined and seems larger without filter at 100x, nearly 10' in diameter but the contrasty edges described above were very muted.  The HII region seems to follow an arc of stars making a partial outer rim. - Steve Gottlieb<p>
