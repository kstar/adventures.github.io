        <td width="50%">Shakhbazian 49 has reportedly been glimpsed in telescopes as small as 12 inches, but we didn't have too much luck with it. It's still worth a try, though, especially
        if you haven't seen the nearby <x-dso>NGC 3158</x-dso> galaxy group, a clump of eight NGC galaxies. Shkh 49 lies only 20 arcminutes northeast of the group, just to the east of an 11th magnitude
        star.</td>

  <p><i>This challenging compact group was a marginal object at 220x-280x. At 220x an extremely faint knot, perhaps 15", was glimpsed several times with averted vision, using a finder chart.
  At 280x, there was a strong impression of two very close 16th+ magnitude stellar objects, though could not view both objects simultaneously. Located 1.5' NE of a mag 10.5 star and 20' NE of
  the N3158 cluster. <x-dso>MCG +07-21-030</x-dso> is situated 7.4' NW.</i> - Steve Gottlieb</p>
