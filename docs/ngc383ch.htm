  <p>Look for the NGC 383 Group (also known as the Pisces Group) about three degrees south of Beta Andromedae. In a 17.5" scope this is a pretty chain of half a dozen fairly bright galaxies.
  It is also included in the Arp catalog of peculiar galaxies as <x-dso>Arp 331</x-dso>: a galaxy chain.</p>

  13: fairly faint, small, round, bright core.</p>
  <p>N0382 = U00688 = Arp 331 = M+05-03-052<br>
  01 07.4 +32 24<br>
  17.5: faint, very small, round. Forms a double system with much brighter N383 30" NNE in group.<br>
  13: very faint, extremely small, round, nearly attached to N383.</p>
  <p>N0383 = U00689 = M+05-03-053 = Arp 331<br>
  01 07.4 +32 25<br>
  17.5: brightest in the N383 cluster. Fairly bright, moderately large, slightly elongated, broadly concentrated halo. Forms a double system with N382 30" SW. N380 is 4.5' NNW, N379 6.8' NNW,
  N386 3.3' SSE, N385 5.5' SSE.<br>
  13: fairly bright, almost round, bright core. Forms a double with N382.</p>
  <p>N0384 = U00686 = Arp 331 = M+05-03-055<br>
  01 07.4 +32 18<br>
  17.5: fairly faint, slightly elongated, bright core. N385 2' N and N386 is 4.3' NNE in the N383 group.<br>
  13: fairly faint, small, round, small bright core. Forms a pair with N385.</p>
  <p>N0385 = U00687 = Arp 331 = M+05-03-056<br>
  01 07.5 +32 19<br>
  17.5: fairly faint, small, slightly elongated, bright core. Forms a trio with N386 2.6' N and N384 1.8' S in the N383 group.<br>
  13: fairly faint, small, small bright core, similar to N384.</p>
  <p>N0386 = M+05-03-057<br>
  01 07.5 +32 22<br>

  <p>N0387<br>
  01 07.6 +32 23<br>
  17.5: extremely faint, round, almost stellar. Located 1.8' NNE of N386 and 2.1' SE of N383 in the N383 group. Not 100% certain of non-stellar appearance.</p>
  <p>N0388 = M+05-03-059 = Z501-090<br>
  01 07.8 +32 19<br>
  17.5: extremely faint, extremely small, round, size 10"-15". Located 5'-6' E of N385 in the N383 group.</p>
