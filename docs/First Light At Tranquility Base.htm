            This was my first trip to a place those who joined me have dubbed "Tranquility Base" in California's Santa Lucia coastal mountain range. I was certainly impressed. Sunset with all
            of us in shadow and the mountain to our south lit in gold tones, clear blue sky overhead, about a dozen cars filled with kids, new observers and experienced observers, Imagers,
            some who are becoming familiar faces. This new remote site was easy to get to on a good road, quiet to the point of no crickets or coyotes, and no (seriously, zero) vehicular
            traffic at night. Even the next morning the place was a treat to wake up to. No required "get out time" making for an unrushed easy pack up and departure home.</p>
            <p>During the night I did a <a href="https://nineplanets.org/estimating-limiting-magnitude/">Finnish Triangles</a> star count in Cepheus and came away with limiting magnitude 7.1.
            A new worthwhile place.</p>
            <p>I was at the eyepiece early, working on Palomar, Djorgovski and Terzan globulars, and even more so on Abell Planetaries - there are sure a bunch up right now. The Pals and
            Abells worked well, but some of the others in the heart of the Milky Way presented real star hopping challenges. I'll return to them though.</p>
            <p>Here's what views I came away with it.<br></p>
