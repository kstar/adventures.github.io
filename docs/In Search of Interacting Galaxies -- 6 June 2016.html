          It’s been over a year since I met up with observing buddies Mark Wagner and Mark Johnston at Willow Springs, one of our favorite observing spots. We were also joined by Mark
          McCarthy, making calling out anyone else’s name in the dark quite amusing!</p>
          <p>The 3000-ft elevation observing site is in the southern section of the Diablo range, probably best known for Mt Hamilton, Mt. Diablo and San Benito Mountain. My drive from
          Berkeley opened up south of San Jose on Highway 101, turning into farmland and ranches after the Gilroy turnoff to Hollister. Once leaving Hollister on Highway 25 (which leads to
          Pinnacles National Monument), it’s all wide open rolling hills through the tiny town of Tres Pinos to Paicines. The last stretch is down Panoche Road, which eventually narrows into
          a winding canyon road towards Willow Springs.</p>
          <p>At the turnoff to the Willow Springs area, I met the three Marks who had arrived a bit earlier. I was also greeted by the sight of crimson-tinged smoke clouds to the west, which
          looked quite ominous. I later learned, this was from the Coleman Fire, which started earlier in the day in southern Monterey County, just north of Fort Hunter Liggett. Although we
          were concerned about the possibility of smoke and fire, we decided to drive up to the observing site. Fortunately, the smoke seemed to stay to the west of us, perhaps due to a
          change in the direction of the winds, and conditions were quite dark all night (SQM readings of 21.7+).</p>
          <p>Observing with my 24-inch f/3.7 Starstructure, I continued to track down little-known interacting galaxies as well as post-merger pairs with double nuclei (see report from
          Memorial Day). Starting at the end of astronomical twilight (now nearly 10:30) until roughly 3:30 AM, I took notes on over 50 objects. Near the end of the evening, Mark McCarthy and
          I shared views of the Hercules Galaxy Cluster, which I wrote about in the Going Deep column for the July issue of Sky & Tel. Another great evening under the stars. Next up is the
          Golden State Star Party in a couple of weeks.<br></p>

          <p align="left">Arp 194 consists of <x-dso>UGC 6945a</x-dso> = VV 126b and <x-dso>UGC 6945b</x-dso> = VV 126a. These form a 40” pair, apparently connected by a bridge. At 260x; UGC 6945a, the brighter northwest
          component, appeared faint, small, roundish, 20". UGC 6945b, the southeastern component, is faint, extremely small, round, 6" diameter. The two glows are separated by 40" and the
          halos were cleanly separated.</p>
          <p>Arp placed this system in his category Galaxies (not classifiable as S or E) with material ejected from nuclei. The SDSS image reveals <x-dso>VV 126b</x-dso> (the top galaxy in the image)
          consists of two colliding galaxies in the process of merging. A tidal tail, consisting of blue complexes of super star clusters, heads towards <x-dso>VV 126a</x-dso>. I wasn't able to use higher
          power in soft seeing to resolve the double nuclei of VV 126b. The redshift-based distance for the pair is ~480 million light years. Check out the HST image at
          http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2009/18/image/a/</p>
          <p>A 2003 paper titled "Evidence of tidal stripping of gas and cross-fueling" described the system as following:<br>
          <i>"The northern component (A194N) is a distorted spiral or ring galaxy likely disrupted by a collision or close encounter with a southern galaxy (A194S). There is evidence that a
          third galaxy with similar recession velocity is projected on A194N, but its role is likely secondary. A194S is connected to A194N by a string of emission knots, which motivates our
          interpretation that the former was the intruder. Three of the knots are easily discernible in B, R, and H images and are assumed to trace the path of the intruder following the
          encounter, which we estimate occurred a few times 100 million yrs ago. Both A194S and A194N are experiencing strong bursts of star formation."</i></p>

          <p>At 322x the western and largest component (<x-dso>VV 136a</x-dso>) of the triple system NGC 4054 appeared faint, small, slightly elongated 20"x15", low surface brightness. The southeast
          component (<x-dso>VV 136b</x-dso>) is smaller but significantly higher surface brightness and was noted as fairly faint, very small, elongated 12"x9" E-W. The centers of these small galaxies are
          separated by just 15". <x-dso>VV 136c</x-dso>, the northeast component, was not seen.</p>
          <p>The redshifts of these three galaxies are nearly identical, so it apparently forms a physical (interacting?) triplet. Surprisingly, there is very little known about this system
          as it has not been studied.</p>

          <p><x-dso>VV 13B</x-dso> is the slightly brighter of an interacting pair (Arp 97) with <x-dso>VV 13A</x-dso> 1.2' due south. A tidal bridge (not seen) stretches from the core of VV 13A to VV 13B. At 260x, VV 13B
          appeared faint, small, round, 15" diameter. VV 13A appeared very faint, small, round, 12" diameter. Often the beginning of the two faint spiral arms was visible (mostly on the
          southwest side), giving a SW-NE elongation and increasing the dimensions to ~20"x12". <x-dso>MCG +05-29-012</x-dso> lies 1.3' SE. At V = 16.4 this was a challenging object, but seen as an
          extremely faint glow of ~10”.</p>
          <p>The redshift-based distance of this trio is roughly 325 million l.y. Although the system is known as Arp 97, it was first catalogued by Russian astronomer Boris
          Vorontsov-Velyaminov in his 1959 “Atlas and Catalogue of Interacting Galaxies”. I wrote about several galaxies in the VV catalogue in the September 2014 issue of Sky and Telescope.
          The article is titled “Seeking Interacting Galaxies”.<br></p>

          <p align="left">I reobserved this pair of interacting galaxies (also viewed the previous Monday night) to confirm the sighting of <x-dso>VV 128b</x-dso>. At 322x, VV 128b appeared extremely faint,
          very small, no structure, but it was confirmed. Situated just off the northeast end of <x-dso>VV 128a</x-dso>, 35" from the center of the main galaxy. <x-dso simbad="Z 09-101">CGCG 09-101</x-dso>, located 7.7' WSW of <x-dso>VV 128</x-dso>, was
          also picked up as a fairly faint, small, round glow, 18" diameter, slightly brighter nucleus.</p>
          <p>The previous Monday night (May 30), VV 128a was logged as faint, fairly small, elongated ~2:1 SSW-NNE, 0.8'x0.4', irregular surface brightness, slightly brighter core.
          Occasionally a 16th mag star was seen at the northeast end (0.4' from center). A mag 15.3 star is 1' SW. <x-dso simbad="Z 098-102">CGCG 098-102</x-dso>, located 12.7' NW, appeared fairly faint, round, 20" diameter,
          easily visible continuously.</p>
          <p>The redshift-based distance for this pair is also ~325 million light years. You’ll find this blue pair (indicating ongoing massive star formation) in Coma Berenices, a little
          over a degree north of <x-dso>M98</x-dso>.</p>

          V = 12.8; Size 1.3'x0.8'; PA = 110°</p>
          <p align="left">As this trio is connected by tidal bridges, it’s surprising it was missed by both Arp and Vorontsov-Velyaminov. NGC 4410 is a merged, interacting pair at 20"
          separation within a common halo. <x-dso>NGC 4410B</x-dso>, the brighter eastern component, appeared moderately bright, small, round, 20"-25" diameter (the halos overlap), very small bright core.
          <x-dso>NGC 4410A</x-dso>, the western galaxy, appeared fairly faint, small, round, 15" diameter, weak concentration, lower surface brightness than NGC 4410B.</p>
          <p><x-dso>IC 790</x-dso> = NGC 4410C, located 1.8' ENE, appeared fairly faint, small, elongated 3:2 E-W, 24"x16", very small brighter nucleus. A very diffuse tidal plume (not seen) connects IC 790
          with NGC 4410A/B. <x-dso>PGC 40736</x-dso>, 2.3' ENE of IC 790 (and also connected by a tidal plume), is faint, small, elongated 2:1 WNW-ESE, 24"x12”.</p>
          <p>A 2002 study states <i>"The NGC 4410 group of galaxies provides us with a rare opportunity to study a nearby example of a radio galaxy (NGC 4410A) embedded in an extended X-ray
          source, with evidence for star formation that can be readily spatially distinguished from regions dominated by the active galactic nucleus and shocks.”</i></p>

          V = 13.6; Size 0.9'x0.8'</p>
          <p align="left">IC 3481 appeared fairly faint to moderately bright, small, round, fairly high surface brightness, 20" diameter, fairly bright stellar nucleus. Based on my size
          estimate, I only noticed the bright core region. IC 3481 is the first of three in a linear trio with <x-dso>IC 3481A</x-dso> 1.4' SE and <x-dso>IC 3483</x-dso> 5.5' SE. IC 3481A appeared faint, small, round, 12"
          diameter, low surface brightness. IC 3483 is fairly faint, elongated 5:2 N-S, 36"x15", low surface brightness. Situated just southwest of a mag 10 star.</p>
          <p>On deep images, IC 3481 and 3481A are connected by a tidal plume and a huge arcing tail from IC 3481A reaches about 2/3 of the way to IC 3483. This apparent interaction was
          discovered by Caltech astronomer Fritz Zwicky before 1952 on an early <x-dso>Palomar 48</x-dso>-inch Schmidt plate. He assumed all three galaxies had experienced a close encounter, disrupted one
          another, and gas and stars had been ejected into space. But IC 3483 has a very low recessional velocity, so only IC 3481 and IC 3481 form an interacting pair.</p>
          <p>More on Zwicky’s discoveries can be found in his 1956 paper “Multiple Galaxies” at http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1956ErNW...29..344Z. The nickname “Zwicky’s Triplet” is
          also applied to other connected systems described by Zwicky.</p>

          <p align="left">At 322x NGC 4519 appeared bright, large, slightly elongated 5:4 SW-NE, at least 1.5'x1.2’. It contains a relatively large brighter core. The halo is noticeably
          mottled with an uneven surface brightness (probably due to HII knots in the arms). The large spiral forms a pair with <x-dso>NGC 4519A</x-dso> 2.6' NW. This companion appeared very faint (V
          ~15.4), small, elongated 2:1 SW-NE, low even surface brightness. A mag 14.3 star is 35" SW.</p>
          <p>These Virgo cluster members have a similar redshift so probably form a physical pair, but there is no obvious sign of any interaction abnormalities.</p>

          fairly faint, small, round, 15"-18" diameter. The southern member (IC 4016) is faint, extremely small, round, 6" diameter. The centers of the two galaxies are separated by just 19”!
          A mag 13.5 star is 44" E and a mag 15.0 star is just under 1' SSW. <x-dso>IC 4027</x-dso>, located 4' SE, is extremely faint, very small, round, 12"-15" diameter.</p>
          <p>This pair resides at a redshift-based distance of nearly 500 million light years. It forms the southern vertex of an isosceles triangle with bright galaxies <x-dso>NGC 4868</x-dso> 12’ NW and
