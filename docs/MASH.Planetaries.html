  <h1 align="center">MASH Planetaries for Hawkeyes</h1>
  <h3 align="center">by Steve Gottlieb</h3>
  <p>Haven't heard of a MASH planetary? The acronym stands for the "Macquarie/AAO/Strasbourg H-Alpha" planetary nebulae (PNe) catalogue. This international effort recently discovered 900
  true, likely and possible new galactic planetaries during an H-alpha survey of the southern galactic plane.</p>
  <p>The discoveries were made using the Anglo-Australian Observatory UK Schmidt Telescope (AAO/UKST) H-alpha survey. This deep, high-resolution survey (<a href=
  "http://www-wfau.roe.ac.uk/sss/halpha/" target="_blank">http://www-wfau.roe.ac.uk/sss/halpha/</a>) was completed in 2003 and used an H-alpha interference filter to cover 233 survey fields.
  By visually scanning these fields under a microscope, the MASH team netted a 60% gain in the total number of known galactic PNe and doubled the number known in the galactic bulge. Final
  results were published in November 2006 (Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 373, 79-94).</p>
  <p>The galactic bulge discoveries tend to be faint but compact planetaries. Outside the galactic bulge, the discoveries generally involve large, older planetaries that were missed in
  previous surveys because of their low surface brightness or by being obscured.</p>
  <p>Is it still possible to observe a planetary that was discovered just a few years ago? Unfortunately, the vast majority of these planetaries are too faint for amateur scopes, but there
  are a few "brighter" entries and with some preparation it's possible to track down some of the MASH objects. Personally, I find it an exciting challenge to glimpse at an object that was
  discovered so recently that you know you're one of the first few observers to have ever taken a look. As of August 2008, I'm aware of observations of 7 MASH discoveries (discussed below).
  If you can add to this list, let me know and I'll post your observations. For the entire MASH catalogue see <a href="http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/vizier/MASH/index.htx" target=
  "_blank">http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/vizier/MASH/index.htx</a></p>
  <p>Here are observations of three summer MASH planetaries I made with my 18-inch Starmaster. You'll need good finder charts as well as OIII or narrowband filters to track these down. The
  following H-Alpha images are from MASH Image Gallery (<a href="http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/vizier/MASH/gallery.htx" target=
  "_blank">http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/vizier/MASH/gallery.htx</a>) and span 4'x4' with north up.</p>

        At 175x unfiltered a mag 13 star was visible and a small ill-defined halo was highly suspected surrounding the star knowing the exact location. Adding an OIII filter, the halo
        brightened nicely and the edge sharpened to a 20" disc. The involved star appeared offset to the north side.</p>
        <p>This object was originally listed in Neckel and Vehrenberg's "Atlas of Galactic Nebulae" as a "star with nebula" and then erroneously included in the 2003 "Merged Catalogue of
        Reflection Nebulae. The MASH catalogue is the first to identify this object as a planetary.</p>

        Picked up at 300x as a very small, faint glow ~5" diameter attached on the NW side of a mag 14.5 star with a fainter mag 15.5 star sometimes visible on the NW edge of the glow. Adding
        a DGM Optics NPB filter, the contrast increased significantly and the planetary was visible continuously with averted vision as a ~10" disc. Surrounded by a small, partial 2' ring of
        mag 13-15 stars.<br></p>

        As this planetary is a recent MASH discovery, I was pleasantly surprised to find a relatively bright, fairly small disc at 175x using a NPB filter just west of a mag 12 star (barely
        detached). A fainter star is just off the NW edge. The planetary had a slightly elongated halo, ~30"-35" in diameter, with a fairly crisp edge. Removing the filter, it was very
        difficult to identify the planetary as it resides in a rich field 75' south of <x-dso>M11</x-dso> and the suspected haziness at the position was similar to the general Milky Way patchiness in the
        field.<br></p>

        The following four MASH planetaries were observed by Kent Wallace using a 20" f/5 Obsession. These are the first known visual observations of these objects.<br>

        was best through the UHC filter.<br></p>

        At 134X, very faint, good sized mottled disk, requiring the O-III filter and averted vision. Fair response to the O-III and UHC filters. No response to the H-Beta filter. Actually the
        UHC filter sems to be a bit better than the O-III filter. At 169X, the image was worse.<br></p>

        <br>
        At 134X, can see it as an elongated object, perhaps a double star with averted vision alone. Using the O-III filter with averted vision a nice small disk envelopes the elongated
        object. Good response to the O-III and UHC filters. No response to the H-Beta filter. At 169X and 254X, the elongated object is a close double star aligned roughly NE-SW with the
        brighter component to the SW. Again, the use of the O-III filter with averted vision envelopes the double.<br></p>
