   Here is what I have on <x-dso>Abell 426</x-dso> = Perseus galaxy cluster, a rich hunting ground for moderate to large sized scopes. There are a total of 58 galaxies included; all objects were surveyed
  with my 17.5", but there are some earlier observations with a 13.1" and 8" scopes. These were all made with mag 6.5 or better limiting mag skies at 220x for the 17.5", 166x with the 13" and
  100x with the 8".--Steve Gottlieb
