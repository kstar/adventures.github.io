  <p>Palomar 2 = M+05-12-001, <x-dso>PGC 15963</x-dso><br>
  04 46.1 +31 23</p>
  <p>17.5: extremely faint, small, round, 1' diameter. Appears as a very low surface brightness spot. A double star mag 13/14.5 located 2.3' NE helps to pinpoint the position. Could hold
  steadily (barely) with averted vision and concentration once identified. A mag 5.6 star lies 40' E.</p>

  <p>Palomar 7 = IC1276<br>
  18 10.7 -07 12</p>
  <p>17.5: at 220x, obvious irregular glow of ~3' diameter just following a mag 13 star at the W edge. A mag 14 star follows and a third star is at the NE end (possibly an extremely faint 4th
  star is also along this string). Appears elongated E-W and the irregular outline increases in size with averted vision to 4.0'x2.5'. Has an unusual mottled patchy appearance although the
  observed stars may be field stars.</p>

    <h2><x-dso>Palomar 9</x-dso> (<x-dso>NGC 6717</x-dso>) in Sagitarrius</h2><img src="assets/pal9.jpg" width="50%">
  </center>
  <p>Palomar 9 = N6717 = E523-SC14, <x-dso>IC 4802</x-dso><br>
  18 55.1 -22 42</p>
  <p>17.5: very unusual small, faint glow located 2' S of mag 5 Nu 2 Sagitarii! The very faint background glow is ~1' diameter but more notable are several superimposed stars. A close pair of
  mag 13.5 stars is at the NE edge 25" from center and a similar star is at the WNW edge 20" from center. There is a very small bright core which on closer inspection appears to be a close
  pair of mag 12.5 stars or possibly a bright stellar core and nearby star (=IC 4802). Other than the central "knot", the unconcentrated 1' background patch has a low surface brightness and
  is much smaller than the listed diameter of 4'.</p>
  <p>13: fairly faint, very small. This globular appears as a hazy patch easily visible just 1.8' S of Nu 2 = 35 Sagitarii (V = 5.0)! About half a dozen stars are either superimposed or
  resolved including two close pairs.</p>

  <p>Palomar 11<br>
  19 45.2 -08 00</p>
  <p>17.5: faint but easily visible. Appears as a large hazy region best seen at 83x. Some faint stars are superimposed and a nice double star is just N.--Steve Gottlieb</p>

  <p>17.5: very diffuse hazy region just NW of a pretty wide triple star, appears elongated. Two faint stars are superimposed. Sighting not 100% but confirmed on the POSS.</p>
