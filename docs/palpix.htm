Appears as a very low surface brightness spot.  A double star mag 13/14.5 located 2.3' NE helps to pinpoint the position.  Could hold steadily (barely) with averted vision and concentration once identified.  A mag 5.6 star lies 40' E.<p><hr><p>  <a name="pal7"></a> <center><h2>Palomar 7 (IC 1276) in Serpens</h2> <img src="images/pal7.jpg" WIDTH=50%></center> <P>  Palomar 7 = IC1276<br>  18 10.7 -07 12<p> 17.5: at 220x, obvious irregular glow of ~3' diameter just following a mag 13 star at the W edge.  A mag 14 star follows and a third star is at the NE end (possibly an extremely faint 4th star is also along this string).  Appears elongated E-W and the irregular outline increases in size with averted vision to 4.0'x2.5'.  Has an unusual mottled patchy appearance although the observed stars may be field stars.<p><hr><p>  <a name="pal9"></a> <center><h2>Palomar 9 (NGC 6717) in Sagitarrius</h2> <img src="images/pal9.jpg" WIDTH=50%></center> <P> Palomar 9 = N6717 = E523-SC14, IC 4802<br> 18 55.1 -22 42<p> 17.5: very unusual small, faint glow located 2' S of mag 5 Nu 2 Sagitarii! The very faint background glow is ~1' diameter but more notable are several superimposed stars.  A close pair of mag 13.5 stars is at the NE edge 25" from center and a similar star is at the WNW edge 20" from center.  There is a very small bright core which on closer inspection appears to be a close pair of mag 12.5 stars or possibly a bright stellar core and nearby star (=IC 4802).  Other than the central "knot", the unconcentrated 1' background patch has a low surface brightness and is much smaller than the listed diameter of 4'.<p> 13: fairly faint, very small.  This globular appears as a hazy patch easily visible just 1.8' S of Nu 2 = 35 Sagitarii (V = 5.0)!  About half a dozen stars are either superimposed or resolved including two close pairs.<p><hr><p>  <a name="pal11"></a> <center><h2>Palomar 11 in Aquila</h2> <img src="images/pal11.jpg" WIDTH=50%></center> <P> Palomar 11<br>  19 45.2 -08 00<p> 17.5: faint but easily visible.  Appears as a large hazy region best seen at 83x.  Some faint stars are superimposed and a nice double star is just N.--Steve Gottlieb<p><hr><p>  <a name="pal12"></a> <center><h2>Palomar 12 in Capricorn</h2> <img src="images/pal12.jpg" WIDTH=50%></center> <P> Palomar 12 = M-04-51-013, A2143-21, Capricorn Dwarf<br> 21 46.5 -21 15<p> 17.5: very diffuse hazy region just NW of a pretty wide triple star, appears elongated.  Two faint stars are superimposed.  Sighting not 100% but confirmed on the POSS.<p>  <center><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="images/Home.jpg"></A></center> <!-- Start of StatCounter Code -->
