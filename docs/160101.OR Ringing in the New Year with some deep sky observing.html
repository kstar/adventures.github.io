          With clear weather on New Year's day (Friday night, 1/1/16), Carter Scholz and I headed for Lake Sonoma in the hills above the Sonoma County vineyards on Dry Creek Road. Moonrise
          was after 12:30, which allowed for up to 6 hrs of dark skies this time of year. As it turned out clouds rolled in at 11:45 PM, shutting us down a bit early but we still had 5 hours
          until clear, reasonably dark skies and seeing (fairly sharp viewing at 375x).</p>
          <p>Mark McCarthy drove up from Fremont with his 20-inch so there were 3 visual observers as well as one or two imagers in the upper portion of the lot. Temps were in the low '30's,
          but it was calm and dry so the chill didn't bother me. Unfortunately, Carter forgot to bring along a piece of equipment for his homemade dob, but we observed together with my
          24-inch, which was a lot of fun.</p>
          <p>Since completing the entire NGC (visible from northern California) about a year ago, I’ve been reobserving NGC and IC galaxies that have nearby companions that were previously
          missed or that I wasn’t aware of. I’m also taking another look at interacting NGCs that appear to be post-merger systems with of two distinct nuclei embedded in a common halo. NGC
          7774 below is a good example. I ended up logging 40 galaxies and one extragalactic globular in about 5 hours — here are the highlights.</p>

          <p>I thought I would take a look at the first object in RA order in the PGC and that’s PGC 2 at 00h 00m 01.7s. So, what about <x-dso>PGC 1</x-dso>? Well, the precise RA is 23 59 58.8 so
          technically, PGC 1 is at the end of the list! At 200x; PGC 2 appeared moderately bright, fairly large, oval 3:2 N-S, 1.2'x0.8', broad concentration with a brighter core, appears to
          have a fairly narrow central bar as brighter along a thin spine N-S. Situated in a very busy star field with a large number of mag 11 stars. <x-dso simbad="Z 548-023">CGCG 548-023</x-dso> (part of a trio with IC
          1525) lies 19' SSE.</p>

          <p>Hodge III is the brightest globular cluster in NGC 147 at V ˜ 16.5-16.8. Compared to the brightest globulars in <x-dso>M31</x-dso>, this one is a toughie. At 450x and 500x it occasionally
          popped at the same position using a detailed finder chart, but I couldn’t hold it for any length of time.</p>
          <p>We first identified two mag 13 stars at 1' separation oriented N-S, which are situated 5' SSE of the center of NGC 147. These stars are just outside the halo of the galaxy. A mag
          14.7 star is 1' further NW, forming an obtuse isosceles triangle with the two mag 13 stars. Hodge 3 is 41" N of the mag 14.7 star and nearly forms the 4th vertex of a parallelogram
          with these three stars.</p>

          <p>So, what’s so special about UGC 2272? William Herschel discovered UGC 2272 on 26 Oct 1786 though he wasn't certain if it was a nebula. He recorded "A star of about 8th of 9th
          magnitude, with an extremely faint nebulosity about 1' north of it; but it so faint that there is a doubt whether it may not consist of 2 or 3 small stars only." His position
          corresponds with UGC 2272, located 2' north-northwest of mag 7.6 HD 17382 but because of the doubt he didn't assign an internal discovery number. If he was a little more confident
          this galaxy would have received an NGC designation.<br>

          <p>At 375x; faint, very small, round, 15" diameter, stellar nucleus. A star (close double on the DSS) is at the northwest edge [17" from center]." Forms a close pair with slightly
          brighter IC 258 1.0' ESE. IC 258 is faint/fairly faint, slightly elongated N-S, 30"x24", small brighter nucleus. A mag 10 star is 1.9' ENE and interferes a bit with viewing.</p>
          <p>Sherburne Wesley Burnham discovered IC 259, along with IC 258, on 3 Sep 1891 while observing double stars with the 36-inch refractor at Lick Observatory. He measured the offsets
          for both objects correctly with respect to 10th magnitude BD +40°608. But he applied his RA (time) offset in the wrong direction for the western object, which he described as
          double. So the computed position for IC 258 is east of IC 259, placing these objects out of RA order in the sky. As a result, the identifications of IC 258 and IC 259 are reversed
          in UGC, CGCG, PGC, HyperLeda, WikiSky, etc. NED has the correct identifications.<br>

          is 50" NE. This pair was also discovered by Burnham while searching for double stars with the 36-inch refractor at Lick Observatory.<br>
