            On Monday night (July 17th), we had a group of 8 observers at Lone 
            Rock including Dan Smiley, Ray Cash, Carter Scholz, Bob Douglas, Dan 
            Durkin and Jim Molinari. I left my house in Albany around 6:30 and 
            drove north on 101 towards Geyserville in very light traffic, making 
            the drive to Lake Sonoma in a quick 85 minutes. Driving across the 
            bay I was surprised it was quite hazy looking west towards Mt. Tamalpais, 
            and assumed it was marine moisture/fog. But during twilight (after 
            I had set up my scope) I noticed haze along the southwest horizon 
            that had a distinct brownish color, likely due to smoke.</p>
          <p>Dan Durkin picked up Mercury during twilight in his Televue-85 refractor, 
            which was barely above the hill immediately west of Lone Rock lot. 
            The elevation was perhaps 5&deg; at the time. We (along with Dan Smiley) 
            had looked for Mercury a week earlier (naked-eye and in binoculars) 
            from just east of the Pinnacles but couldn&#146;t be certain of the 
            sighting. Next Friday (July 28th) Mercury will be within 15&#146; 
            of Regulus and a bit higher. Should make an interesting pair.</p>
          <p>Some thin smoke may have impacted transparency as early on the Milky 
            Way had a washed out appearance with little visual structure. But 
            as the Milky Way rose higher and my eyes became fully dark adapted, 
            the transparency seemed to improve to average for the site. Bob Smiley 
            registered SQM readings in the 21.1-21.3 range suggesting my unit 
            (which was left at home) would have recorded 21.2-21.4 based on previous 
            comparisons of our devices. Seeing was better than predicted on weather 
            models and I had no problem using up to 566x with pretty sharp stars 
            using my 14.5&#148; Starmaster.</p>
          <p>I started off the night viewing comet C/2023 E1 (Atlas) which was 
            discovered in Virgo on March 1st this year. It is now in the northern 
            part of Draco and circumpolar. At 9th magnitude it was fairly bright 
            at 87x, quite large, but with only a modest concentration in the center. 
            It reached perihelion on July 1st and will be closest to earth next 
            month in eastern Cygnus (August 18th). Check it out if you have a 
            chance. </p>
          <p>In the current issue of Sky &amp; Tel, I wrote an article about Williamina 
            Fleming&#146;s deep sky discoveries, which were made while working 
            on the first comprehensive catalog of stellar spectra. This spectroscopic 
            project began in the late 1880s at the Harvard College Observatory 
            under the directorship of Edward Charles Pickering and was eventually 
            completed by Annie Jump Cannon, using the familiar &#147;O,B,A,F,G,K,M&#148; 
            classes. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Draper_Catalogue">Henry 
            Draper Catalog</a> encompasses over 350,000 stars and the HD numbers 
            are still used today. Pickering&#146;s innovation was mounting an 
            objective prism on a short-focus astrograph. This way, instead of 
            recording the spectrum of a single star, scores of stellar spectra 
            were captured on each glass plate.</p>
          <p>But before embarking on this Draper project, Pickering did a limited 
            visual spectroscopic survey for planetary nebulae between 1880 and 
            1883. He described the inspiration and technique using Harvard&#146;s 
            15-inch refractor as follows:</p>
          <p>&#147;A direct-vision prism was placed between the eyepiece and the 
            objective of the telescope, thus forming a spectroscope without a 
            slit. When a star was brought into any part of the field it was spread 
            out into a colored line of light, the rays of each wavelength forming 
            an image of the star in a different place. A nebula, on the other 
            hand, being mainly monochromatic, would form a point or small disk 
            of light. The difference in these appearances is so marked that the 
            idea suggest itself that this device might serve to detect any minute 
            planetary nebulae, which could not otherwise be distinguished from 
            stars. Accordingly, a systematic search for such bodies was undertaken. 
            A power of about 140 is employed with a field 12&#146; in diameter. 
            The telescope is clamped in right ascension and moved through 5&deg; 
            in declination. This is repeated so frequently that the successive 
            sweeps shall overlap, the region continually varying by the diurnal 
            motion.&quot;</p>
          <p>His search netted 15 new planetary nebulae (all in the NGC) in the 
            summer sky and I had time to carefully examine a dozen of these. Since 
            they are tiny (a few essentially stellar even at high power), blinking 
            with an OIII or narrowband filter (UHC or NPB) is necessary at low 
            power. To identify the field I used paper charts (Megastar) with stars 
            plotted to at least 14th magnitude. All of these compact planetaries 
            are from 11th to 13th mag and are visible in an 8&#148; or smaller 
            scope. The only challenging part is the Milky Way fields can be incredibly 
            dense, so you can get overwhelmed by the multitudes of stars trying 
            to pin down the location. The HST images below don&#146;t reflect 
            what you see in the eyepiece ;-)</p>

<p align="left"><br>
            Confirmed by blinking with an OIII filter at 182x only 1' S of a mag 
            10.4 star. Excellent contrast gain with the filter and equal to the 
            much brighter star. At 226x a small blue-grey disc was visible, just 
            a few arcseconds in diameter. The best view, though, was unfiltered 
            at 352x and 566x with the disc spanning 4&quot; or 5&quot;. Occasionally 
            I had the impression of a brighter central peak (central star?).</p>
          <p align="left">Pickering discovered NGC 6439 on 18 Aug 1882 and noted 
            &quot;mag 13. A star, mag 11, north 1' and follows 1 second.&quot; 
            MegaStar software (and probably others) misidentifies the mag 13 star 
            that is 1' north as NGC 6439.</p>

          </p>
          <p align="left">Easily identified at 66x (straight-forward to match 
            up field stars with chart) including mag 7.1 HD 165202 7' to the NE 
            and a mag 11.6 star 1.5' WNW. A rhombus with sides ~2.5' and mag 11-12 
            stars is centered 7' NW. At 122x, the PN displays an excellent contrast 
            gain blinking with a UHC filter and seemed slightly non-stellar (&quot;soft&quot;). 
            Increasing to 264x resolved an obvious 5&quot; to 6&quot; disc, which 
            was prominent at 395x.</p>
          <p align="left">Pickering discovered NGC 6537 on 15 Jul 1882 and called 
            it &quot;small and bright.&#148; Based on photographs taken with the 
            Crossley reflector at Lick Observatory, Heber Curtis (1918) reported 
            NGC 6537 as &quot;a minute disk 5&quot; in diameter, just distinguishable 
            from a star. Round, with clear-cut edges; a slightly condensation 
            at center is suspected, and a very faint ansa in p.a. 25&quot;. The 
            huge hourglass-shapes structure visible in deep images that surrounds 
            the central part was missed in the Lick photographs. The nickname 
            &#147;Red Spider Nebula&#148; is probably based on the Hubble image 
            that was released in 1997 (below).</p>

          </p>
          <p align="left">Identified by blinking with an OIII filter at 66x, which 
            gave an strong contrast boost.The location was pinpointed using a 
            mag 8.3 star 4.3' SW. Increasing to 122x and 158x revealed a small, 
            but clearly non-stellar glow. 395x provided an excellent view with 
            a nice-sized ~10&quot; disc. A mag 12.5 star is 40&quot; NW, a faint 
            pair is 40&quot; S, and a mag 12.5 star is 1.0' ESE.</p>
          <p align="left">Pickering discovered NGC 6565 on 14 Jul 1880. This was 
            the second of his 17 planetaries found using a direct-vision spectroscope. 
            Compared to NGC 6644, which was discovered the next night, NGC 6565 
            was &quot;somewhat fainter, but with a larger disk.&quot; (The Observatory, 
            1881). Heber Curtis (1918) described NGC 6565 as &quot;a minute oval 
            ring 10&quot;x8&quot; in p.a. about 5&deg;. Considerably fainter along 
            the major axis, and the center is relatively vacant.&#148;</p>

          </p>
          <p align="left">NGC 6567 is situated in a spectacular field at 87x -- 
            remarkably rich in stars with a very obvious dark lane (~25'x6') running 
            ~SW-NE&quot; just west of the planetary, ~. The correct &quot;star&quot; 
            was highly suspected before blinking because of its slightly soft 
            appearance. It brightened significantly using an OIII filter. A very 
            small blue disc was clearly resolved at 158x, forming a &quot;double&quot; 
            with a fainter field star just 10&quot; E. Excellent view at 395x 
            with a crisp edge to the disc and the nearby star well resolved. The 
            PN seemed slightly elongated and irregular at 566x.</p>
          <p align="left">NGC 6567 was discovered on 18 Aug 1882. Williamina Fleming 
            rediscovered this planetary on Harvard spectral photographs and reported 
            it as new in 1895, perhaps missing the earlier discovery. Curtis (1918) 
            described NGC 6567 as &quot;an oval disc, growing rapidly brighter 
            toward the center; 8&quot;x5&quot; in p.a. 150&deg; in the shorter 
            and about 11&quot;x7&quot; in the longer exposures. Exceedingly faint 
            ansae are suspected in the prolongation of the major axis, making 
            the total length 20&quot;, but these may be very faint stars&#133;&quot;</p>

          </p>
          <p align="left">Using 87x (unfiltered), the planetary is fainter of 
            a &quot;double&quot; with an 11th mag star close SW [22&quot; separation]. 
            Adding an OIII filter the PN appears significantly more prominent 
            than this star. At 158x, it is clearly non-stellar at the east end 
            of a string of stars extending to the west. A triple star forming 
            a small equilateral triangle (sides 20&quot;) is 1' SE. Excellent 
            view at 395x with a substantial disc 8&quot; to 10&quot; diameter.</p>
          <p align="left">Pickering discovered NGC 6578 the same night as NGC 
            6567, as well as NGC 6439. A quite successful night of observing! 
            Curtis (1918) reported NGC 6578 as &quot;nucleus almost stellar; mag 
            15. Disk nearly round, 8.5&quot; in diameter; no ansae or structural 
            details discernable.&#148;</p>

            Identified as a slightly soft bluish star at 87x, with a fainter 13th 
            mag star close NNW [34&quot; separation]. Appears very small, but 
            clearly non-stellar at 158x. Increasing to 395x shows a nice 8&quot; 
            disc and adds a 14th mag star close west [by 18&quot;]. At 566x, a 
            mag 14.5 star was seen SSW [by 25&quot;]. Located 16' N of STF 2434, 
            a wide pair of mag 8.5 stars at 27&quot; separation.</p>
          <p align="left">After discovering three planetaries on the 18th, Pickering 
            discovered NGC 6741 the following night. Robert Jonckheere mistakenly 
            catalogued this object as a double star (J 475) in 1911, based on 
            observations with the 14-inch equatorial refractor at the University 
            of Lille. The following year he reobserved it with the 28-inch Greenwich 
            refractor and realized it was nebulous and identical to the planetary 
            NGC 6741. Curtis (1918) noted &quot;No central star. A small bright 
            oval, 9&quot;x7&quot; in p.a. 95&deg;. It shows traces of an indistinct 
            ring structure, being somewhat fainter along the major axis. There 
            is a small, scarcely perceptible protuberance at the western end.&quot;</p>
          <p align="left">John Mallas coined the nickname &quot;Phantom Streak&quot; 
            in his Jun/Jul 1963 article &quot;Visual Atlas of Planetary Nebula 
            - part V&quot;, published in the &quot;Review of Popular Astronomy&quot;. 
            He wrote: The &quot;Phantom Streak.&quot; First you see it and then 
            you don't...In the 4-inch looks like a broad silver line. Almost uniform 
            in brightness, the ends appear broken and diffused...My visual impression 
            agrees with H.D. Curtis's description of this object. He states &quot;It 
            shows some trace of a ring structure, being somewhat fainter along 
            the major axis.&#148;</p>

            Using 66x, NGC 6790 appeared as a bright, mag 10.5 &quot;star&quot;, 
            which blinked dramatically with an OIII filter. A mag 12 star is 0.6' 
            W. At 140x, NGC 6790 was slightly soft and showed a pale blue color. 
            Increasing to 352x, a high surface brightness small disc was definite, 
            perhaps 2&quot; diameter.</p>
          <p align="left">Pickering identified NGC 6790 on 16 Jul 1882 using the

            Appears as a mag 11.5 stellar planetary at 66x, with an excellent

            was resolved. Increasing to 395x the disc appeared 3&quot; to 4&quot; 
            diameter and it seemed slightly non-uniform at 660x.</p>
          <p align="left">This one was found on 17 Sep 1882 and described by Curtis 
            (based on a Crossley photograph) as &quot;a minute round disk, 5.5&quot;

            Easily identified at 87x by blinking with an OIII filter, but completely

            this star is clearly brighter than the PN, but the relationship dramatically 
            switches using the filter, for a 3 magnitude contrast boost. NGC 6807 
            appeared stellar at 395x and even 566x. Located 18' NE of orange mag

            19 49 46.6 +48 57 40; Cyg<br>
            V = 12.1; Size 2&quot;</p>
          <p align="left"><br>
            Picked up at 87x as a 12th magnitude pale blue &quot;star&quot; and 
            verified with an excellent contrast gain by blinking with an OIII 
            filter. Appears bluish at 226x and looks like a slightly soft star. 
            Strongly suspected to be non-stellar at 396x, though less than 2&quot; 
            diameter. At 566x, I had the impression of a central star and a minute 
            2&quot; halo. </p>
          <p align="left">Found on 8 May 1883. Again, Curtis wrote &quot;indistinguishable 
            from a star on the Crossley negative, but shown to have a minute disk 
            visually with the 36-inch refractor.&quot;</p>

            20 10 23.6 +46 27 40; Cyg<br>

          <p align="left"><br>
            Easily identified as an 11th magnitude &quot;star&quot; in a rich 
            star field because of the dramatic contrast gain blinking with an 
            OIII filter. At 140x it was definitely non-stellar and showed a blue-grey 
            color. Increasing to 264x showed a small blue disc 5&quot; to 6&quot; 
            diameter. Easily held both 397x and 660x due to the high surface brightness. 
            Numerous stars are within 2' at high power with the brightest mag 
            12.2 star less than 2' NW. A mag 14 star is 0.9' NNW and a mag 14.8 
            star is 0.5' SE. Two more mag 14.5-15 stars 0.9' S.</p>
          <p align="left">Pickering discovered this planetary on 8 May 1883. Unfortunately, 
            he made a 1 hour error in the RA and it was cataloged as NGC 6766 
            with the wrong position. Ralph Copeland found it again (using the 
            same technique) a year later at Dunecht, Aberdeen, in Scotland and 
            reported it as new. Curtis (1918) reported that &quot;no central star 
            can be distinguished. A minute, bright, round disk, of nearly equal 
            brightness throughout, with a suggestion of an elongated brighter 
            central portion in p.a. 135&deg;; 7.5&quot; in diameter in a 5 min 
            exposure.&#148;</p>

            20 10 26.7 +16 55 22; Sge<br>
            V = 12.7; Size 5&quot; </p>
          <p align="left"><br>
            Identified as a stellar object in a rich star field by blinking with 
            an OIII filter at 87x. Using 158x it appears as a slightly soft bluish 
            star with an excellent contrast gain with a NPB filter. A brighter 
            mag 12.1 star is 1.5' SW, but the PN dominates the star when I add 
            a filter. Two other star are close by; a mag 13.6 50&quot; NW and 
            a mag 14.2 star a similar distance SE. Excellent view at 395x, which 
            shows a very small 5&quot; disc with no central star. Located 14' 
            NE of STF 2634 = 7.8/9.9 at 4&quot; separation.</p>
          <p align="left">Pickering discovered NGC 6879 on 8 May 1883 and independently 
            rediscovered by Ralph Copeland on 9 Sep 1884 at DunEcht, Scotland. 
            He remarked &quot;equal in brightness to a star 10.2 mag. Diameter 
            4.6&quot; by micrometric. It has an 11 mag star at 222.27&deg;, distance 
            83.2&quot;.&#148; Based on a Crossley photograph, Curtis stated it 
            had &quot;A minute disk, 5&quot; in diameter, just distinguishable 
            from a star. Fades out slightly at the edges.&quot;</p>
