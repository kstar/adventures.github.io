            Clear skies were predicted for Sonoma County (north of Santa Rosa) 
            on Saturday night, April 15th, so I headed to Lake Sonoma, near Geyserville, 
            and met a half-dozen other Bay Area observers. The forecast called 
            for above average transparency, though the seeing was expected to 
            be below average or poor. Instead of lugging my 24&#148; Starstructure 
            for one night, I decided to take my smaller scope - a 14.5&#148; f/4.3 
            Starmaster (Zambuto optics), which made set up a snap and permitted 
            using an adjustable observing chair over much of the sky.</p>
          <p>It turned out the skies were crystal clear, except for one band of 
            clouds that slowly passed through to the south, with above average 
            darkness for this site (SQM readings of 21.4-21.5). We were surprised 
            that the seeing turned out much better than expected, with pinpoint 
            images at moderately high power. The one downside was a steady breeze 
            that persisted through the night, enough to be an annoyance at times 
            with a few loose charts flying off my table that I had to chase down. 
            I took notes on 30 galaxies, so the ones below are just a small sample 
            &#151; but all follow the super theme. I returned to observe at the 
            same site two nights later (Monday, April 17th) and will post a separate 
            report.</p>

          <p align="left"><br>
            As far as the super-night, one highlight was IC 3322A = UGC 7513 (12 
            25 42.9, +07 12 58), a fairly dim super-thin edge-on, a little over 
            a degree southwest of M49 in the Virgo cluster and 20&#146; ESE of 
            the giant elliptical NGC 4365. The galaxy was stretched 10:1 NNW-SSE, 
            roughly 2.0&#146;x0.2&#146; &#151; just a low surface brightness streak 
            with no distinct core or nucleus. </p>
        </div>
        <p>But planted on its north tip was the &#147;prominent&#148; 13th magnitude 
          Supernova! This Type Ia was discovered on March 30th at the Zwicky Transient 
          Facility (ZTF) at Palomar, with a camera that captures a 47 square degree 
          field and images 3750 sq. degrees per hour. The supernova, designated 
          SN 2021hiz, is likely near maximum brightness as it dominated the glow 
          of the edge-on galaxy!<br>

          Next was NGC 5018, a bright elliptical in southern Virgo (13 11 45.7, 
          -19 15 42). The galaxy was logged as &quot;bright, fairly large, slightly 
          elongated, ~1.8'x1.5', very strong and sharp concentration with a small, 
          very bright core and an intense nucleus. A mag 14.6 star was seen just 
          outside the halo.&#148; NGC 5018 appears to be a post-merger as a deep 
          image from the VLT Survey Telescope in the Atacama Desert reveals outer 
          shells and star streams &#151; likely the remains of a cannibalized 
          galaxy. Just 7&#146; ESE is NGC 5022, which I recorded as &quot;fairly 
          faint, very thin edge-on ~6:1 SSW-NNE, ~1.5'x0.25'. A mag 11.1 star 
          is ~2 N. &quot;</p>
        <p>The real target, though, was another Type Ia supernova, SN 2021fxy, 
          discovered nearly a month ago by Koichi Itagaki, a prolific supernova 
          hunter from Japan with scores of discoveries to his name. It was seen 
          as a mag 14.2 &quot;star&quot;, just 20&quot; N of center of the galaxy, 
          close to the edge of the core and within the halo. A similar mag 14.1 
          star was noted 2' N of the galaxy. </p>

        <p align="left"><br>
          UGC 9242 is a super-flat galaxy in Bootes (14 25 21.3, +39 32 18) &#151; 
          in fact, one of the narrowest known, with dimensions 5.0&#146;x0.25&#146; 
          (nearly 20:1 axial ratio). Here&#146;s an excellent image from the late 
          Rick Johnson, who often posted on CloudyNights. I&#146;ve observed this 
          galaxy several times before (including through Jimi Lowrey&#146;s 48&#148;), 
          but this view was using Bob Douglas&#146; 18&#148; Starmaster. It was 
          an extremely faint sliver at least 2' in length. A mag 13 star is less 
          than 1' S of the ENE tip and helps to pinpoint the position of the dim 
          streak.<br>

          <img src="images/UGC%205459.jpg" width="600" height="600" border="1"> 
        </p>
        <p align="left"><br>
          Although not quite as flat as the last galaxy, UGC 5459 in Ursa Major 
          (10 08 10.3, +53 04 59) still qualifies as a super-thin (nearly bulge-less 
          edge-on). It&#146;s brighter than UGC 9242, but is nearly hiding behind 
          a mag 8.7 star! At 158x, it wasn&#146;t difficult &#151; a nice streak 
          extending ~2&#146;x0.25&#146;, seeming to shoot out from the star. The 
          galaxy has a low surface brightness, though, with only a weak brightening 
          towards the center. The superimposed star (HD 87704) is one of 4 bright 
          stars in the field forming a very distinctive rhombus shape.<br>
