# Adventures in Deep Space

Welcome to the Adventures in Deep Space (ADS) git repo. ADS is one of the earliest resources on the internet catering to the needs of [hobby astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_astronomy) engaging in visual deep-sky observing at an advanced level. It remains to be an important resource to hobby astronomers today.

## Philosophy
ADS is one of the few places that delivers deep-sky observing content,
* as full-fledged articles,
* sourcing content from many authors
* in a static website
* free for anyone to access

There are many other incredible resources out there that are assets to our community. The [Deep Sky Forum](https://www.deepskyforum.com) and [Cloudy Nights](https://www.cloudynights.com/) are excellent platforms for online interaction between hobby astronomers. [Sky and Telescope](https://skyandtelescope.org/) and [Astronomy](https://www.astronomy.com/) magazines publish excellent deep-sky observing articles, sometimes also online. There are many excellent books written about deep-sky observing, such as the [Annals of the Deep Sky](https://shopatsky.com/collections/annals-of-the-deep-sky), or the series of Springer Praxis books on visual observing (here is an [example](https://books.google.com/books?id=ofVGAAAAQBAJ)), or many books by Stephan O'Meara, Phil Harrington and others. Many amateur astronomers maintain excellent websites that are invaluable to others in the hobby; some examples who come to mind are [Alvin Huey](http://faintfuzzies.com/), [Paul Alsing](http://www.pnalsing.com/home), [Howard Banich](https://sites.google.com/site/howardbanichhomepage/observations/), [Uwe Glahn](http://www.deepsky-visuell.de/), [Reiner Vogel](http://www.reinervogel.net/), [Mel Bartels](https://www.bbastrodesigns.com/) and I am sure there are many I have failed to recall or am unaware of.

Although ADS was started (by Jim Shields and Ray Cash; and then furthered by Mark Wagner and Steve Gottlieb) long before many of these other resources existed on the internet, I believe it is very much relevant today because it is one of the few places serving long-form static article content without a paywall, sourced from many different authors. We will continue to serve visual observers the encouragement to seek some of the more exotic, challenging or otherwise obscure targets they would not have otherwise come across.

ADS is now managed by a team of three California bay area visual astronomers -- Mark McCarthy, Vishal Kasliwal and Akarsh Simha -- with continued involvement and the mentorship of previous maintainers Mark Wagner and Steve Gottlieb. The website is now backed by an open-source repository for a reason: we invite contributions from advanced deep-sky enthusiasts that are novel and germane to the style of the website. Our efforts aim to lower the bar for folks who are passionate about writing articles but are not necessarily skilled with web technologies.

## Contributing: Background

To contribute to ADS, get in touch with one of the admins, such as by e-mailing your proposal to [adventuresindeepspace@gmail.com](mailto:adventuresindeepspace@gmail.com). Or simply file a pull-request (PR) against this repo with your article content. The admins (present and previous) have the final verdict on whether to accept your changes, of course, and can therefore merge pull requests into the `main` branch; if your content is not deemed to be a fit for the website, we encourage you to post it on your personal website, or some of the other forums mentioned above. 

### Licensing

By contributing your content here, you agree to share it under a liberal license -- either Public Domain, or Creative Commons Attribution 4.0. This website is not monetized. You understand that there is no compensation for volunteering to contribute to this website. Figures and other content that you use that are not your own may come from more restrictive sources so long as they fit the [Fair Use](https://nwtc.libguides.com/c.php?g=43772&p=7188025) policy. Crediting your source is strongly encouraged where applicable. If you wish to use a DSO image and not sure where to pick from, here are some ideas: The Hubble Space Telescope products are _generally_ in the public domain, although sometimes credit is due to the ESA or STScI (which are not US Govt entities) or to the person who processed the data (e.g. [Judy Schmidt](https://www.flickr.com/photos/geckzilla/)). DSS2 images from the [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/) are generally free for non-commercial use and we believe this website qualifies (we will not run ads or make money off of it).

If you do not specify an explicit license in your article, by submitting it for consideration you agree that your work can be shared under Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0.

### What to write

This website is all about _visual deep-sky observing_ projects that are _challenging_ or otherwise novel / unique / obscure. This means ADS is **not** the right place for, to give a few examples:
* a report on some bright Messier or NGC objects that does not bring out some novel detail in the objects
* an imaging marathon
* telescope making articles
* presenting scientific research on a DSO (although we will entertain some of this in context to shed light on an interesting visual target)
* presenting research on the history of a DSO (again, some of this is okay in context)
We may make exceptions at our own discretion.

It should be noted that we are not restrictive to large aperture or any specific instrumentation constraints -- although large aperture helps on many of the challenging targets, a set of really challenging targets observed through binoculars or the naked eye is as relevant to ADS.

To get a good sense of what to write about, take a look at the many articles already present on this website.

There are generally three kinds of things that are germane to this website:
* Observing Reports
* Deep-Sky Observing Projects (a single object or a list of multiple targets with a common theme, written with notes placing it in historical and/or scientific context, images and finder charts, and your experiences observing them)
* Listings of interesting objects to observe (e.g. "Selected Abell clusters expected to be interesting in a 25-inch telescope")

## Contributing: Workflow

Once you are ready to "write" your article, look at our [MarkDown example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kstar/adventures.github.io/main/docs/example.md). Although we will "begrudingly" accept contributions in other formats like HTML, MarkDown is preferred: it is easy to write, and we can use our styled templates to generate a uniform look-and-feel for the website.
